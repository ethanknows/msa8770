       "[' these are hands down the best quality bands for the money i am a 38 year old male and wanted a resistance band set that i could travel with as well as use it at home with my p90 workouts i specifically wanted bands that were made with high quality material and would not break after a few months after months of research i pulled the trigger and bought black mountain resistance band set these bands met all of my expectations and more they are high quality and multiple bands can be combined for added resistance the travel bag makes it easy to travel with since i am always on the go my wife always really liked them and we ordered a second set to replace her flimsy less quality bands thanks black mountain for producing a great product at a fraction of what other competitors are selling them for i just got this set yesterday as well as a set from another company so i could compare the quality the other set seems to be made pretty well but these from black mountain are higher quality the nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look ive been using resistance bands for years not as my sole resistance routine but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they havent as they are very effective as these eventually wear out as they all do in time ill replace them with black mountain products again my only complaint is there is a slip of paper that came with the bands offering me a free orange band but the phone number given doesnt seem to connect to anything my husband uses these and finds them to be good for his arthritis stretching exercises i got these for christmas and have been using them multiple days a week since the resistance is great i would agree that the low resistance is pretty worthless but maybe some use it i was a little skeptical about the customer service given the review but i called to inquire about these before purchase and they answered right away which gave me a little more confidence so far so good i will let you know if there are any issues with the bands themselves after continue usage between 34xwk havent had it long enough to use all of the components but so far im impressed with the quality of the material i also really like the fact that you can remove and mixmatch the bands using the hooks on each end all in all so far so good and they do what theyre meant to do will update once i can try the other exercise positions using the door anchor im not a weight guy and ive tried resistance bands in the past and was never that impressed this product is great it doesnt have that flimsy cheap feel it feels solid and offers good resistance and is easy to use ive used it now for a while and i will keep on using it instead of throwing it in some drawer to gather dust i would highly recommend this product for both beginners and veterans and it is compact enough to take with me on trips i love this product upon first receiving it i was skeptical that these would provide a good workout but i can assure you after doing a little 10 minute workout found on youtube these little bands deliver i was so sore after just a short workout i highly recommend this product to anyone considering a home exercise product to keep themselves fit excellent packaging the whole set fits neatly into the carrying bag excellent for travel the bands appear to be of superior quality when compared to spri connecters work well as does the door mount stacking the bands is easy and quality control has ensured that the bands are of consistent length awesome purchase received these as a gift construction seems pretty legit i like the carabiners vice plastic clips of competitors the handles and other attachment points feel quality perfect to stay on track while traveling and cant take the weights with me would recommend this product and company to friends and family alot of bang for the buck effective work out without the hassles of changing weight and buying expensive equipment best of all you can take it with you when traveling it comes with a carrying case and has an instruction manual which clearly shows the different exercises and how to set up what is needed good for a light workout it is very portable gives you more variety of exercises you can do and takes up much less space then a set of dumbells the bands are sturdy and the connections at the end are solid and seem well made overall a very good value as long as you arent looking for real heavy lifting i purchased these bands to help restrengthen after shoulder surgery and have been very happy with them quality is excellent its fast and easy to change the handles from one band to another and the carrybag has made it easy to take these with me wherever i might travel highly recommended they tore up after a little over a year and im not very strong poor quality also one of the handle got bent but you can still work out with it when they tear it can be painful so i suggest if you must buy this brand replace every year these were perfect for my home gym easier to store and move than dumbbells and significantly cheaper the handles and door frame loop are advantages over traditional bands and make them feel more like gym machines than exercise bands great product  i dont have time to go to the gym and this product is very good because i can take it anywhere i just started using it with my p90x and it works very well im happy with this product and would recommended to anyone bought this for use while i was in physical therapy and am pretty happy with it for convenience factor it can be cumbersome though when having to switch out different bands over an hour or hour and a half of working with them good set of resistance training equipment my wife and i both use it its easy to use and comes with an easy to read guide and is well made and well thought out small package stores easily just about anywhere my item arrived exactly as advertised so far im pleased with my purchase the bands seen well made and sturdy and easy use and switch out the carrying bag is a plus as it nearly holds everything nice and neatly these are awesome i love that i can exercise at home and that this equipment is small enough to just tuck away when im done the anchor is the best part as all you need is a door and your good to go great set i have been using these bands for about 2 months and they are great i had double shoulder and bicep surgery this year and these bands are perfect for my at home exercises prescribed by my physical therapists i use mine for physical therapy it is truly a well manufactured product i think the price is right considering the level of excellent constructioni rarely give a 5 star but in this case they deserve it great product i love the fact that you can clip multiple bands together for increased resistance they are great for a quick workout during a work break highly recommended this is the best set of resistance bands on amazon at an amazing price they offer great resistance and provide you with plenty of exercises that you can use these bands for really great quality equipment i used them as soon as i received and was very happy received as promised packaged well and a nice note from the company  great touch these are awesome they work very well and i would definitely buy again i love that they stack and the piece to hold in place on the door is so awesome best purchase totally recommend great price for quality product bands are study and the accessories are what really make

mountain products resistance band set with door anchor ankle strap exercise chart and resistance band carrying casethis resistance band set has very good quality i really like them they are colored for different weight i believe they will last long time the product is good the problem is i didnt get the yellow and green bands i also didnt get the manual that was supposed to be included this has been a great versatile way of exercising while on the road ive used it for a few months now and have no complaints ive had this product for over 6 months and use them 2 to 3 times per week theyve held up well with no significant wear this package of bands grips ankle strap  door strap give my workouts way more options easy storage takes up no room great set of bands with a useful beginners manual and i needed it as a beginner myself it was a great purchase deilvery timely and accurately a bit of a run around to get the free extra band but it is what it is good price sturdy great for working out i love the book it comes with showing variety of ways to use it a good inexpensive workout great for apartment dwellers surprising how it works your core this is a great travel set and the bag is nice to be able to throw in my travel bag great product i use it every day very convenient and the stackability is great no excuses  this is a great quality product and works if you do would buy two

is not vey good easy to use booklet full of workout routines love this product good quality and price great resistance band set for starters perfect meet all my needs great for use anywhere good but not for me works well for me good quality all good  i bought this kit 2 winters ago we have a ranch house on the side of a mountain and it gets very cold combine that with really crummy old windows and our house was freezing not good when you pay for home heating oil it was so bad at one point that when it was windy outside i actually witnessed the drapes in my house billowing into the room that is when i decided to purchase this kit i actually got 2 kits to make sure i could finish all the windows in my house and i ended up having plenty left over i installed the double sided tape and stuck on the plastic used the blowdryer to warm it up and shrink wrap the windows and i was done no more draft or chilly rooms you are supposed to take it off after each winter but i have left it on for 2 years now i find it also keeps my house cooler in the summer combined with thermal drapes you have a combination for energy savings pros  sticks great and lasts for a long time once you get the hang of it its easy to install really has saved us money on home heating oil cons  if you dont totally shrink the plastic you can see the ripples from the outside of the house and it looks a little messy but if you do it right it is crystal clear it is awfully hard to get the double stick tape off if you leave the product up for a long time we are now going into our third winter with the same kit on our windows and we are only now noticing some of the windows are losing their plastic in some places peeling etc but thats to be expected when its only supposed to be left on for a shorter period of time my apartment has a front living room with three windows that let in very cold air in winter so i moved my living room into the middle dining room i keep the door between the two rooms open enough for my cats to get through i rarely go in the front room in winter because its so cold my friend helped me install this insulator which turned out to be very easy just apply the doublesided tape around the frame attach the plastic and then blow dry with heat to tighten the plastic i can barely even see the insulating plastic the only problem is that i had to decide if i wanted the window blinds up or down because the plastic covers the entire window casing you will not be able to use your blinds or shades just drapery ive lived here in erie pa seven years and ive wasted so much money on gas when i moved from the front room to the middle room and kept the door between the two ajar instead of wide open i reduced my monthly gas budget from 98 to 72 now that i have this product my monthly amount is 42 unbelievable this is a great product to prevent leaky windows from succeeding in letting cold air inside the tape holds well when the outdoor wind blows please read exercise patience measure twice before you cut the film and allow for an extra inch dont skimp or you will regret it read trying to pull too tight when mounting and risk not fitting or tear of film glad i bought one extra box to learn from mistakes and not have to wait endure more cold i like that visibility outside is not compromised i love this product we have an old house and a lot of leaks around the windows this significantly changes the room temperature it increased the warmth of the room significantly it took us one window to figure out the technique for putting it into place and once we got the technique down it was very easy to put in place use the hair dryer at the end to tighten up the material and you are good to go will be using this for every winter from here on out for the cold chicago winters great product seals great and definitely makes a huge difference in temperature my heat kicks on less often depending on window size you can sometimes get more than 3 windows out of it most important step not to skip is making sure your window sill is clean if its not the insulator tape is not going to stick and cold air will seep in what a waste of money first off let me state that is product may work if you ever get it applied to he window after multiple applications trying to center a giant sheet of saran wrap around super sticky tape i am probably qualified to fuel jets mid air this product is beyond infuriating perhaps a team of 4 would have no issues my brother installed these for me he used a hot blower gun sort of like a hair dryer and it shrunk it so that i cannot even tell that there is plastic over my windows seriously they are invisible i can tell already that it will keep my daylight basement warmer  i highly recommend this such a simple solution and it really works older home not able to afford fancy new windows i immediately put this on my worst problem window and its made a big difference helped keep the room much warmer my girlfriends room is above the garage so we insulated the windows to cut down on the cold air getting in it definitely helped super easy to use never needed to use a window insulating kit before but was pleasantly surprised at how much it helped the draft coming from my windows for us it did not work we couldnt get tape to stick nor plastic to shrink for us this wasnt a good buy and we needed up using duck tape lol reallt easy to use great to cover the windows to keep out the cold air this comes w double sided tape to help gm\\xc3\\x84\\xc2\\xa3  do be careful using pressure to smooth the film when sticking it if you rub it with your fingernails you can tear it easy to apply  kind of fun watching it contract when using the blow dryer does a great job keeping the cold air old good for keeping the cold out measure first and clean the surface properly used for camp sticky tape didnt work yeah im pretty happy about 3ms whole system of these no matter what size there is a bit of a learning curve to get them to lay flat but thats life kids ive been using them for the past 2 years and i live in chicago i cant verify due to changing weather temps if ive saved money on my heating bill but id like to think so its well worth the price of them and i definitely notice the drafts stopped the windows are always icing up from condensation once it gets below 32\\xc2\\xba ive tried ceiling fans to keep the air flowing but to no avail these window films do the trick every time no more icing up no more water from condensation on my window sills no more mold growth from the moisture buy them put them up and stay warm all season easy to use worked great there are not 5 different sheet of material for 5 windows rather there is one large sheet that you have to cut into 5 pieces to make it work for 5 windows otherwise its a fine product it did a perfect job of keeping the cold air out around our ac so that we did not have the hassle of removal and storage this is the first time i used 3m window insulation and istallation was a breeze the scotch tape held like a champ and the plastic is so clear that if you give it good heat from the hair dryer it almost feels like there is nothing in front of window highly recommended for the cold weather our heat is off for good few hours during the day and night i purchased this fire extinguisher in 2001 and it has sat on my kitchen counter ever since on march 17th 2012 my next door neighbor was outside his house and very foolishly poured gasoline from a full 25gallon container onto a pile of hot smoldering wooden logs of course the can exploded and it landed against the outside of his 2story house the house is wood frame house with painted wood siding at this point he was on fire so he rolled on the ground to put himself out he ended up with 3rd degree burns but his next action was to get up and come find me i was working outside raking leaves when i heard him screaming by this time the fire is raging against the outside of his house the flames were about 810 wide against the side of his house and touching the top of his 2nd story gutter as he was panicking and calling 911 i quickly retrieved the small kiddie fire extinguisher from my kitchen and ran towards the blaze at this point i am thinking i am shooting a bbgun  read more these should be in every car there is no reason not to have one on you even just driving in a city and daily commuting it could mean the difference in saving a car or a life i have 2 in my jeep especially when off roading purchased after a crazy nye night where it took two of the things to put out trash can fire in the garage must have for any middle aged man wanting to save face while putting out fires from used fire works in a garbage can great fire extinguisher for a great price but came with a broken wall strap making it impossible to secure to the wall very disappointing maybe it was on the shelf too long and the plastic got brittle ever since there was a fire in our neighborhood i started making all the precautions to prevent fire and thats why ive been buying these fire extinguishers well never when we would need to use it can never have too many safety items at home or in your car or in your office you wont be putting out forest fires with these but its a nice thing to have if not for the ease of mind it offers i havent had to use it yet however just having it makes me feel safer for having it honestly for the price everyone should get one for a just in case situation while it hasnt had to be used i am sure it does its job as it feels like a substantial product the price was less than a lot of hardware stores appears to be a solid built fire extinguisher but fortunately i havent had to use it and i hope i never will arrived fully charged neatly packed and with a wall hanging unit fits under kitchen sink too the fire extinguisher was fully discharged upon opening the package it was a mess outstanding product the price and freaky fast delivery  it is good to have in your home this old man is not taking any chances this is a need to your home good item for the household bought as a gift this is defective and does not work it is unbelievable that defective safety equipment is being sold still available for purchase and that more effort is not being made to warn people who bought it great this is the perfect brush for cleaning hydroflasks i previously used baby bottle brushes to do so but i find that this ones better i purchased this bottle scrubber to clean the glass water bottles i have because i dont feel they come super clean from the dishwasher this brush works fine for one of my bottles but the bristles are more stuff than i hoped for and its not flexible the brush is good quality though and feels like it will last a very long time fits into nooks and crannies of bottle and breast pump parts which has greatly assisted efficient cleaning 4star rating because for these purposes the handle and neck are a bit long and there is no stand the brush is a bit more awkward to store in the kitchen otherwise a great product that is priced well perfect brush for my nalgene bottles gets into the wide mouth and the smaller water bottle sized mouth once this one gets wrecked from vigorous cleaning ill be sure to pick up another i use it to wash out our soda stream bottles and it works great this is the second time i purchased this product as i used the first one to the end of its lifespan perfect length and quality product i use it to clean my growing collection of swell bottles good length as it reaches the bottom of the 24oz swell got this to clean my soda stream bottles and its the perfect size super soft bristles and the wand part fo the handle is nicely flexible great for glasses also use the brush on sensitive pans to avoid scratching looking for a brush like this one for other pans and dishes lasted about a month for cleaning the water bottle i bought worked well and i felt good that my water bottle was good and clean the handle could be a little more sturdy but otherwise i like this product it reaches and cleans bottles from inside very well one of the best bottle brushes ive used works wonderfully to clean out our nalgene 1000ml water bottles was left in hot water in the sink and deformed the bristles cannot get them to return to shape the sturdy bristles scrub well and fit through most openings and the handle is a good length brush works great with the hydro flask i will buy another one of these for other uses so far great more of 8 weeks of usage and no problems at all recommended excellent brush for use with an oxo electric tea kettle made mostly with glass totally awesome means of washing the inside of your sport drinking bottle stained surprisingly easily which leaves it looking dirty all the time would buy again or give as gift great for cleaning hard to get places the handle is a bit short otherwise its a good product works great i think i have used it around a year good tool but wish the bristles were more tough nice quality been taken over by everyone else nice brush but would prefer stiffer bristles good product fast shipping excellent buy nice soft brush good for nonstick pans perfect for cleaning my swell bottles good grip non shedding bottle brush great for tight spots cleans well great price good little brush cleans my mason jars well use it and it works well works as expected quality product as expected works decent super cheap very sturdy dont work perfect works nice perfect perfect i checked the product details and the packaging mine arrived in is different from what is advertised the advertised packaging specifically says it is the only original us packaging and yet mine was completely different in shape form and design this problem is in addition to the fact that the infuser displayed wear and tear symptomatic of use despite the fact that it was purchased new i like the design but the quality is so bad i used it about 5 days a week the chain was detached at the third time well thats not a big deal but it got so much metal rusti thought its tea stains but not whitin one month i dont feel safe it doesnt close properly and the loose leaf tea i use always comes out into the water and i have to pick a lot of it out i will definitely be looking for a better one crap when closed still has massive gaps so all but the largest tea pieces float out might as well dump loose leaf tea right into your water it would be just as good for the money i really cant complain about this tea ball the only thing is that it doesnt shut all the way so every cup of tea has lingering loose leaves within it easy clasp to open and hook to latch onto cup handle they also tell you how much tea for each cup which was handy for me as i am new to the loose leaf game these bags are awesome first time shopping for reusable bags and i picked a winner even checkers have asked me where i got them love them \\xc2\\xbb great practical stainless steel mesh ball perfect size and the material doesnt leave any taste in the beverage i would recommend it been using regularly for months and it is still in like new condition no issues with tea leaves falling out while steeping i bought to make large portions of loose leaf tea but the leaves fall out of the sides and into my tea so i rarely use it lost the lip clip the link at the loose end of the chain after maybe 3 days worked great up to that point ive been using this product very reliably for many years and only now has it started to rust great product its awesome quality and has been a great companion for my tea  clasp broke off after a couple months rendering it unusable broke after a few uses very flimsy shipping was slow product did not work at all  i am very disappointed i buy loose teaworks like a charmeasy to clean rusty and hard to clean after a few uses high quality and it works as it should easy to use works well easy to clean broke before it made it to my mug well made and sturdy works great it was awkward working with this works with leaf tea great small very bad material great item fast delevery works really good wonderful product good product works great breaks fast perfect love it love it good i love it watching the tea spread from it is lovely makes having tea a little bit nicer i couldnt live without this tool in my kitchen i am zesting and grating regularly and having a microplane in easy reach is an essential i have several styles of microplanes for grating different things and different sizes but this is the one i use the most for limes lemons oranges etc fits right in the dishwasher when i am done and is always sharp and useful this was a replacement for one that i had had for many years and it had finally gotten a little dull but after ten years of essentially daily use i guess it was allowed to be not so sharp microplane is a great grater we bought this planer on the advice of our daughter whose kitchen philosophy is have a few gadgets but make them high quality this grater planer works very well i typically use it to zest lemons or to grate parmesan cheese it does both jobs perfectly and is easy to clean nowi buy cheese in a block which is better cheaper and keeps longer so this has become one of my favorite kitchen tools i use it to easily grate down garlic into a fine consistency that almost melts into soups and sauces its also perfect for getting the zest off of lemons or oranges its a delightfully versatile tool that is absolutely worth it this microplane is fantastic and i use it every day great for mincing garlic zesting lemons or limes grating cheese etc have bought additional ones for friends and family  great buy a must have  if you need a zester so easy to use and makes fast work of citrus peel you can quickly add citrus zest and clean up is so easy storage of this slim item is easy too love these i purchased one for myself a while back and loved it so much i got one for each of my daughters its reasonably priced and the quality is very nice as well weve had this for two years so many other microplaners fell apart but this one is great and we use it all the time i only wish it were slightly easier to clean i love this microplane we use it mostly for citrus zest and parmasen cheeses on our pastas its dishwasher safe it can be sharp though so be careful the first few times i used it i ended up with a little bit too much finger in my finger food if you know what i mean watch yourself love this zester it give me the type of zest i need without it being mush very well made an not hard to clean really works and is perfect for my receipes that call for a bit of lemon lime ginger etc zest larger than i thought it would be and had a larger shaving than i wanted\\xc2\\xb6 it dose work well perfect exactly what i was looking for perfect for zesting lemons or shredding nutmeg best grater ever super fine grateperfect for fruit zesting and hard cheeses not great quality wish i had researched some more items before buying this one ive had this for around a year now and i have no complaints it works very well cant believe ive waited so long to order one of these i use it all the time i love this thing perfect for zesting and grating of cheesespices very sharp dont know why its taken me so long to get one of these awesome kitchen tool',\n",
       " ' i love this thing perfect for zesting and grating of cheesespices very sharp dont know why its taken me so long to get one of these awesome kitchen tool love it do not know how i lived without this for so many years nice product every kitchen should have one  sharp for grating hard cheeses fruit zests good cheap grater does what its supposed to do and the price is right this saves me so much time when i need a little lemon zest for a recipe this is a terrific zestervery sharp and easy to remove the zest helps shred cheese with ease kinda hard to clean sometimes dont even know if i got credit for a damaged product sent this works great for ginger and turmeric root love it broke after three uses handle separated from metal i have used many graters this one is the best if you want a great zester this is the one very good quality sturdy and easy to use great for zesting lemons for limoncello excellent zester so happy i bought thos havent used it yet but looks great meets all my expectations works great as expected a must in the kitchen quality product great quality excellent great son wore out the first one he had it works great without any problems i have one got this for my nieceshe was thrilled wonderful accessory use it regularly great quality exactly what i needed and the quality is great worked great with the unit and easy to clean works better than a way more expensive one works great for venison great the key to a good coffee or spice grinder is a nonoval nonelliptical interior that kicks the spice into the blades krups adds a flat side to the cap interior so it does this and grinds well but krups makes the cap from a cheap brittle plastic that spontaneously cracks from normal use i patched the first crack but others kept coming  there are already five after three months of use  and this means that cap will sooner rather than later break apart see photo amazons price was 1999 but i bought mine at bed bath and beyond with a coupon that brought the price to 1500 pros cheap powerful motor and blades cons uneven grind smallish capacity if youre looking for a coffee grinder i wouldnt recommend a bladed one especially if you care about using the right size grind for the right drink blade grinders are cheap but a burr grinder ensures a uniform grind which is important to get a consistent flavor and brew this grinder however would be perfect for spices and i would actually recommend using it only for that cleaning is relatively easy just use a damp paper towel to wipe up the remains and a dry one to finish the job i got this for my parents who love coffee they didnt really like this product and actually went back to their old coffee grinder something about how the beans werent grinded up too well or something so im guessing this product isnt really for coffee addicts this thing can grind it has ground up everything i have placed in it with ease now the bad stuff the unit is really really hard to clean the only way to keep it clean is to wash it after every use i use it to grind up foods i have dehydrated it has powdered up sweet peppers carrots kale beets lime ginger and turbinado sugar so after each use i had to clean it up it was a big chore due to not having any napkins i bought a brush to clean it but it isnt the best thing and you will need to put some water in it to get the dust out from the bottom of the blade the unit does seem to be waterproof but i am not trying to find out it did shoot water out from the lid so i learned really fast to only place a small amount in there at a time as to allow the particles stuck under the blade to remove themselves the unit itself is surprisingly heavy after a few uses it stopped working but with a few shakes it would turn on i believe it stopped working due to the lid not being down all the way i want to process coffee beans at least once to see the end results but from my experience i dont know how anyone could get anything but a fine grind it seems to powder everything in seconds in seconds you can see powder forming on the lid i have no idea how i would get a coarse grind with the krups maybe the result is different with coffee beans than with dehydrated food i imagine i would have to pulse it for no longer than a second this is exactly what i was looking for though in the end so i give it 5 stars replaced a really old grinder of similar type by cusinart this one works great and i like it since it has a larger capacity for beans so i can grind more at once of course the grind depends on how long you hold the button down i like mine ground fine for an espresso machine some powder tends to cake under the blades i have developed a habit of holding it up when i push the button and tilt it sideways back and forth during grinding to facilitate mixing one would do well to count the seconds for the grind you like so to be more consistent over time i believe it takes about 10 seconds to get to a fine enough grind after done i put the gound coffee into a small can making a day or twos worth at one time so it is always fresh one needs to use their finger or another object to get the caked product out of the bottom but it is not a big deal it is easy to clean with a paper towel around the inside tapping the remainder out i found a small brush which i use to get grind out of the crevasses overall i find it is a great value and works well for small portions i buy and use whole spices from a health food store it is fresher and cheaper than packaged spices on the grocery shelves it allows me the flexibility to purchase exact amounts for a particular recipe without wasting the unused portions instead of buying individual spice mills i wanted one mill that could do all types of grinding coarse or fine i went to americas tedt kitchen website to read their reviews this product was 5 star rated knowing i could trust their experience and review i purchased the mill it livesup to its claim it has a removable cup for easy pouring and cleaning its the only spice mill i need and yes it does awesome with coffee beans nuts etc i highly recommend this product it is easy quick and produces an even grind on a mission to replace my last coffee bean grinder i spent considerable time reading reviews of the toprated ones i finally decided on this one big mistake the krups f203 does indeed grind coffee beans but trying to transfer the grounds to one\\xc3\\xa2s coffee maker results in a huge mess i wouldn\\xc3\\xa2t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices but it\\xc3\\xa2s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans summary i quit grinding coffee beans shortly after i started using this grinder thanks to this purchase i\\xc3\\xa2m back to buying preground coffee gimme my old grinder back recommendation against all reviews do not buy this is my first ever coffee grinder and i chose this one because of the low cost and the compact design it has been fantastic addition to our kitchen we have fresh ground coffee every day so delicious it is incredibly easy to use not too noisy and so compact i can tuck it away in the corner and it takes up no space my only complaint is that it is fairly easy to spill some on the counter when opening the top after youre done grinding im not sure if this is a universal problem with grinders or the design of this one i just try to be extra careful to minimize spillage so happy i chose this grinder when you are looking for a grinder you do not realize how important they are until you get this one then you grind your first cup of beans and omg this little machine is unbeatable it is like the ferrari of grinders 5 seconds and you have a perfect ground blend ready to make your day start off with a bang i used some in the military that actually stunk they were slow got stuck not this one this one takes a mundane task and makes it extra ordinary i will use a krups for the rest of my life no doubt about it grinding cup is not removable and product is difficult to clean  i have to turn the grinder upside down and tap with a spoon to get the ground coffee out of the grind chamber and there is a reside of coffee left on the lid as well as the chamber you cannot adjust the grind and the top can be difficult to remove at times i have to use a damp paper towel to clean the unit every time i use it which is a pain pros easy to use compact design reasonably priced cons this should only be used for grinding spices i do not suggest using this for coffee you will not get a consistent texturegrain size buy a burr grinder for your coffee beans instead difficult to clean the blade fully especially underneath the blade youll have to use a pipe cleaner or a thin piece of fabric i have had this on my wish list for a while and got this for christmas from my fathernlaw we both love coffee and love the strange brews from all over the world i have a different coffee maker than he does so this will come in great use when i give him coffee i ground my first batch already i didnt grind the whole bag because that will ruin the flavr of the bean bought this one to replace an earlier model that id been using since 1978 the earlier model still worked well but it looked awful after years of use and some accidents i expect this model will last as long  it certainly does the job well i detect no loss of quality from the earlier model i use mine for grinding spices and just occasionally for grinding coffee beans this is great i bought 3 bags of whole bean coffee online by mistake and didnt want to return them so i bought this grinder its fast easy to use and the cleanup is simple i dont know how long this sort of appliance usually lasts but regardless its cheap enough that i wouldnt mind replacing it after a few years wonderful buy this works well for small quantities it actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder which has several settings that said this grinds finely so if you need a coaster grind this may not be ideal it arrived in proper packaging and has been in use for nearly a year and still performs wonderfully this is a pretty good coffee grinder but coffee tends to pack around the edges of the inside requiring a utensil to scrape the coffee out also if youre doing a fine grind its sometimes hard to get very fine unless you fill it at least 23 but generally works well and no problems with the motor strong little grinder and works as you would expect the issues are with the actual lid to get the foodcoffee from the top you will ned to turn the whole thing upside dow and pat the machine to get it all out without a huge mess not a big deal but that great of a design i bought this for grinding dried peppers for jerky and curry making the grinder works great and youll get very fine powder be careful though as the dust can get in the air quite easily and like me youll be end up with a runny nose sneezing for 15 minutes or so oops this makes a huge mess coffee grinds everywhere need a brush to get them out grinds get compacted under the blades and will not come out unless you use a brush and then it becomes a mess i am shopping for something else do not buy this love this spice grinder it works on everything literally plus when i have to grind coffee beans occasionally for relatives the smell doesnt linger inside afterward as long as i clean it well with a wet cloth no complaints this grinder works very well with the regular filter coffee makers i found the grounds were too small for my reusable kcup which may just mean a new kcup would do the trick however the quality of this product is great bought this for my husband for christmas and he just loves it its incredibly easy to use one button operation easy to clean as well plus it makes the kitchen smell great while its grinding coffee beans  small and powerful not much else to be said here i just wish it did a better job of uniformly grinding the beans other than that this thing works flawlessly a little messy but its coffee whadyagonado so far so good i initially bought a hand grinder  ceramic type to keep the coffee as pure as possible but i found that it was taking way too long to grind this is a good fast solution this is a nice simple little grinder you cant grind huge batches of coffee at a time but thats fine for us i havent used it for spices yet but im sure it will work great when i do this product is excellent its inexpensive and made with quality its a great coffee grinder there are no fancy settings you control the type of grind manually but its very easy use i purchased this to replace a coffee grinder that i previously had for 10 years i have used this for coffee and spices works great runs smoothly and quietly yikes the current model is made in china and fills the room with a very pungent electricity smell and does not have the power my old krups grinder had do not buy excellent tool we had it for over a year with no problems does a good job grinding coffee does not heat the grounds too much and keeps the oils and flavores in i bought this for my son and he loves it it grinds the coffee beans perfectly and fast he really likes the fact this grinder also grinds spices too nice fine grounds does a great job these units usually dont last more than a year time will tell if this holds true for this unit we own two of these one for spices and one for coffee they work great and are super easy to clean we just use a little bit of dried rice my first time ever using this or grinding coffee so easy coffee is so much better and fresher i love this size because its only for me grinds well quiet but the lid leaves a little to be desired it is long and fits inside causing beans and grounds to cling to the sides i love this product its small so its easy to store its quick and efficient and not very loud and i got it for a great price i use this to pulverize my dehydrated hot peppers from my garden grinds them into the finest dust just what i needed i just needed to grind my own coffee as i am becoming a coffee snob this seems to do well but i am just learning so i use it every morning works great i put 8 tbsp of coffee beans in it takes about 10s to turn them into a fine powder since i bought it i have used it almost everyday the only problem is that the coffee ground sticks to the container does the job perfectly nice shape for pouring directly into coffee maker once chopped great price recommend highly great grinder for coffee durable replaces our old braun grindersimple one function grind no bells or whistles this was my first attempt at grinding i was not impressed functioned sufficiently but not as fine as id hoped basic coffee grinder not very loud grinds beans perfectly use daily clean with a small unused makeup brush just purchased and i really like it so far its super simple design and low noise makes for a great grinder  perfect and powerful just what i needed to get the most nutrients out of the nutsayay i am in love thanks i grind spices and nuts with ease  even grind oats to make flour  this is the best kitchen tool yet  works perfectly as advertised used for the freshest coffees taste and aroma grinds spices well too worked extremely well on dried muscadine grape seeds was very happy with our ground flax seeds cheap works well this little thing is dependable and perfectly grinds my coffee beans love this grinder high quality and grinds perfectly very happy with this product been griding coffee for a year without any problems makes for a nice even grind this works great for me i found no need of a timer and the grind is perfect after a couple of months doesnt grid beans well big pieces in grids been using to grind my chaga to put in a tea bag works like a charm good grinder works well but is somewhat hard to clean quick ship strong motorgrinds coffee very quickly and effectively turns whole beans into fresh ground coffee excellent grinder small solution to grinding coffee with less counter space wonderful simple works very well and very good value use this to cut corners prepping in the restaurant good purchase very satisfied with the quality a year and half later still works great it grinds evenly but its capacity is less works well enough for its price no issues works really really well as expected first one returned due to burning smell essential for good living i love it great gift loved it arrived fast works great used as a spice mill used it for years and its great so far so good after 3 months ive been using it a lot very quick and efficient grinds coffee perfectly powerful work good nice worked great works as expected now thats coffee perfect grinder great product wife loves it great grinder great product does the job works great great value it grinds perfect bad really great product i use it for spices coffee truvia it makes it into a fine powder love it this is a christmas present to someoneso do not have like or dislike yet it works well but the container is too small for us end up returning it i had the same problem that others on amazon are having with this product who likely left bad reviews as im doing here right now i just purchased this same filter from walmart recently along with a brand new brita water pitcher yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each otherand the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well i thought i was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing and watching the dirty water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir i just cringed and scratched my head after triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly i pushed so darn hard that i was ready for the unit to break the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housingand alas water still leaks through and the filter clearly does not seal well with this unit i find it almost humorous that i only came here to read these amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after i decided to google my problem and see if there was a magic solution and i see brita repeatedly replying with were sorry call our customer service and we will helpor you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down if you go onto britas website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there you will also find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass throughalong with the same sad responses from brita support which seemingly makes brita look like theyre being proactive unfortunately as in this case sometimes replying with the same canned responses that dont really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well clearly brita is in denial or wont publicly accept fault for this issue i think the worst part in all of this though is that there are likely many consumers who get their new brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old brita filters worked and they dont even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesnt seal properlycompletely in a watertight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus so all of the great things brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this youre buying a filter to clean your water you dont even notice its not cleaning your water and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightlylessdirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesnt seal well the essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter all of the water not just most of itif the product cant filter 9999999 of the water being poured into it then it is most certainly a defective product giving the benefit of the doubt to brita that they arent purposely and knowingly selling a defective filterdesign its still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isnt lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters fyi brita customer service if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly properly and easily sealed when insertedthen i know you havent read or care about what i say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue no need for me to call brita customer service either im going to buy a filter now from your competitor and i can only hope it works the way it should thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your ceo and coo and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet i bought my brita pitcher years ago and the filters looked different when i first bought it so i was nerves that my pitcher was too old and it would not fit but it was no problem since these filters fit perfectly the top of these filters look different it has a thinner top i love it because it is easier to grab and take out of the pitcher the old filters i had to struggle with to get out sometimes i had to disassemble to top of the pitcher and push the filter from underneath these new filters seem to get rid of that problem also there is barely any presoaking required i got these out of the package expecting to soak them in a bowl for several hours but the instructions said to just rinse it for a few seconds so no more having to get a bowl out for filter replacements the quality of the water is good too i don\\xc3\\xa2t notice any difference in the quality of water from the old filters the price is reasonable i got a five pack for 2456 this comes out to under 13 cents per gallon if i use the recommended 40 gallons per filter i use these filters in my brita pitcher to transfer the filtered water into my 5 gallon jug that sits on the cooler i refuse to spend 12 for 5 gallons of spring water i have no idea if it really is spring water i let my water sit open for 24 hours or more prior to filtering so the chlorine can vaporize and leave the water this allows the filters to last longer i have a water tester and my water tested with as many or more particles after using the filter it does get rid of the chlorine and they put a lot of chlorine in our water rural water system tried the cheaper nonbrita filters and they just arent as good unfortunately these new brita filters also do not require a 15 minute soak in water you instead just run cold water over the water filter now for 15 seconds and it is ready to go also there are so far a lot less black flecks in the top of the brita canister and the water tastes great overall to save a 1502 ish dollars the offbrand filters are just not worth it my guess is they do not contain as much activated charcoal i base this on my vast knowledge of water filter technology and science background that comes with being a communications major so basically nothing but the filter is great i do not buy bottled water i drink tap watersometimes funny tasting tap waterhold yer nose sulfur water that im told is good for me um but two years ago i was gifted with a brita pitcher it really makes a difference i soon needed replacement filters because i followed manufacturers instructions dont follow manufactures instructions ive found that i can use brita filters for many months and the water quality is crystal clear and without any unpleasant taste i only replace filters when the filter gets clogged up i started using the brita water pitcher over 5 years ago i always complained about how hard it was to remove the filter from the pitcher until now thank jesus for rd now they made so its very easy to get out and you do not have to soak it in a glass of water anymore these filter works great and you can really tell the difference when drinking water no chlorine taste and no charcoal flakes floating around in the water good price great product i only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars are meant for angels and gods works like it should water tastes great filtered with this a great price for all three good price for perfectly in the brita slim 5 cup pitcher filter leaks and a large portion of the water does not get filtered through my brita 10 cup grand water pitcher i purchased this filter so as to remove the unpleasant taste of tap water this filter only diminishes the taste as much of the water still gets through unfiltered as this does not accurately fit my pitcher yeah this is a brita review because why because these little boxes of charcoal make my disgusting dirty hot tub smelling municipal chlorine and flouride bath straight from the sewer tap water taste like im drinking straight form the freshest mountain stream these things work wonders works well it did come loose in the pitcher once and carbon dust came out and settled at the bottom after repositioning the filter and cleaning the bottom of the pitcher there was no more carbon dust i love these they are more people expensive at the store so better to by then on amazon i did not give them a 5 star because i cant tell what is actually filtered out only a lab could been buying these replacement filters for years great price with this bulk purchase really makes my water taste delightful also use filtered water in coffee maker and iron switched to pur because these filters went bad so quickly now the pur filters take forever to filter but still better than brita in my opinion fits better  water taste exactly like that comes out of the rap which is awful shameive been a happy customer for many years i got these and ended up splitting them with a friend great option instead of getting them from the store so much cheaper brita filters are good in general but do not filter deposits i sometimes see small particles of debris or sand dont have to soak it like the old ones no more black specks in the fill tank i like the improvements we live our brita pitcher the 3 pack was a good deal well be stocked for a few months now these newer style of filter general release less carbon black sediment in the water was messed up in the box wouldnt recomment and it doesnt filter out lead it claims to remove the heavy metals except i do not see lead on their list great  keep the pitcher filled to fill my keurig coffee pot very pleased with my purchase exactly what i wanted leaking black water for dayswater tastes weird no surprises good value not for retail packaging more convenient and cheaper than in stores my water is even cleaner now all the time good product but package not togged perfect you can taste the difference what can i say its a brita filter easy to use and work as expected as expected and at a great price these do a good job of filtering works great and taste great fast delivery good product works as it is supposed to great product  good price typical quality brita items makes the water taste great you need filter at beijing on time and as advertised needed by my brita machine great filter great price goes well with piture very good thanks as advertised a great buy great price good product works great very useful very good love it great good job perfect sometimes i wonder if the sensor on my brita filter means it really needs to be replaced or if its just a way for them to get me to buy more either way i replace these after a few months of use works wells well its a water filter not much to say cool stuff did not work on camping trip tried to filter my urinne to make clean water how do i apply for a refund great product be careful with stirring it when you are making carmelsweet corn the handle has a plastic gear on it and that can break if you twist it too hard or too fast i love making my own popcorn with olive oil and a little salt you dont need to buy their brand of popcorn they are great tasting but they are expensive do not buy another brand of ready to use popcorn oil and salt bags if they are cheap they will taste horrible just use regular popcorn one tablespoon popcorn to one tablespoon olive oil 45 tablespoons for 2 adults should be pretty close to perfect salt to preference great white elephant gift our family loves popcorn we were buying bags upon bags of popcorn to pop as our night time snack during family time there is no better snack on movie night in our house that is why when i saw the wabash valley farms whirleypop i couldnt wait to try it i read the mixed reviews and was cautiously optimistic the product arrived with a 55 oz wabash valley real theater popcorn allinclusive kit winning i was super excited for the bonus popcorn to try out our whirleypop for the first time we made our first batch of popcorn the night it arrived the directions included were super easy to follow and in 3 12 minutes we had perfectly popped buttery popcorn just like that in 3 12 minutes i was mom of the year the whirleypop was constructed really well all the pieces look like they will last a long time i had read a lot of comments about the gears breaking and i dont know if the company has improved that piece but mine appear to be extremely solid and well made i will update again after continued use i purchased the whirleypop in june 2015 through amazon a little over 6 months ago i would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it broke within 6 months and the wabash valley farms replacement cost despite its warranty is something you might want to consider when you purchase along with which version of the popper youd like i learned from the folks at wvf that the gears on the version amazon sells are plastic i hadnt known there were two versions of this popper available from wvf one with plastic gears and one with die cast metal gears wvf said that amazon opted to sell this version only but i could be upgraded to a replacement cover with the metal gears for an additional cost wabash valley farms has a 25 year warranty on its products but it cost me an additional 16 to upgrade to the metalgeared cover i thought i should warn other potential customers that given the real cost of a replacement that would last they might want to purchase the version with the metal gears in the first place \\xc2\\xa0the whirley pop is the best thing since sliced bread ever since i was a little girl i have loved homemade popcorn my grandmother would make it for us whenever we spent the night theater and microwave popcorn cannot hold a candle to grandmas popcorn a friend recently gave us a whirley pop popcorn popper oh my goodness this thing is the bomb tonight i made my second batch and it was as perfect as the first one was not one single unpopped kernal i seasoned the pot per the enclosed instructions before first use for both batches i used 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and one half cup orville redenbockers original gourmet popping corn both batches turned out perfectly i attached video to demonstrate how easy it is to use and the amount of popcorn in a single batch i had recently tried kettle korn and fell in love with the salty and sweet taste i tried to recreate it at home but just burnt my pots twice i looked up some recipes and came across a clip of martha stewart making some with the whirleypop after watching the video i placed an order for it when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it came with a bag of popcorn with butter i tried to make the kettle corn again and this time it was a success i have also made regular butter popcorn successfully if you do kettle corn add the sugar and salt a minute after you put all the corn kernels in they will be a whitish color thats the best time to add it in this popcorn popper is simple but works so well i received it as a gift and i wont make popcorn with anything else i use 12 cup of pop secret popcorn and a little bit of corn oil and i get 10 cups of perfectly popped popcorn every time i just made some and had just one unpopped kernel the only downside is that you have to hand wash lidhandle but i feel like thats a small price to pay love ithighly recommend what keeps me from loving it is the material used it feels like thin cheap metal that will damage pretty quickly ie burn marks that wont clean up as well as a pain to clean on the inside waiting to see what happens 5 uses in but so far so good just wish the metal was a little more sturdy or thickfirm i bought this product because i knew it would be far healthier than microwave popcorn it scratched the hell out of my stovetop with one use i never moved the pan just twirled the bottom of the pan appeared to not be flat it wobbled all over the burner dont buy this product if you value you stove i bought this as a surprise for my popcorn loving wife her words one of the be presents ever she is beyond pleased with the quality of the popping and taste of the popcorn it works just the way it is described and eliminates clean up too if you like popcorn you will love the whirleypop i bought this for my partner who had burnt up my big soup pot making popcorn he bought me a new pot for christmas  this popcorn maker is awesome for folks who just dont like the taste of air popped the handle is connected to a wire i believe hes used the thing every day since christmas all i can say cant go wrong with a whirley popwe had our old whirley pop for several years and had to get anouther oneif u want good popped popcorn the whirley pop is the way to go better then the electric popcorn poppersif u buy you wont be disappointed slight pain to clean not its fault really i love popcorn i use jiffy pop kernels or orville reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn cabot cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal its like crack you cant stop eating it',\n",
       " ' slight pain to clean not its fault really i love popcorn i use jiffy pop kernels or orville reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn cabot cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal its like crack you cant stop eating it works beautifully saves money compared to microwave popcorn when you use this to pop corn you get a truly healthful snack low in calories no artificial color flavor or preservatives i had forgotten how good freshly popped popcorn is love it easy to use easy to clean i was a bit worried that my lack of hand strength would make it hard to crank but not an issue in the least leaves very few unpops much healthier than microwave and just as fast i love this popcorn maker we have given up making instant popcorn and only do on the stove popcorn it doesnt take that much longer and it tastes so much better i definitely recommend this product have been using one of these for several years now great productworks well pops complete and

burns all over my palms happy that this ones ergonomic layout wont allow such to happen again way easier than holding a lid down while shaking the pot i havent had a burnt kernel yet seems well made with metal gears do yourself a favor and get a whirleypop stop eating microwave popcorn i bought two of these last summer and both broken in less than 6 months the plastic gears broke on both of them after being used 12 times a week for less than 6 months this is hands down the best and only way to make popcorn i now have popcorn at least three times a week for dinner thanks to this fabulous thing this is my second whirleypop the first one lasted over 15 years it makes great tasting popcorn the handle makes it safe for kids to help if you like popcorn you need this product we make ours with organic coconut oil and himalayan salt its easy to clean too i love this thing great tasting popcorn and you can make it healthier than the popcorn you buy at the store love follow the directions and the device does what it is supposed to do pop corn takes about five 5 minutes less than half the price of chefs version and just as good love it perfect gift we love our so much we gave this as a gift to my sisterinlaws family this year this makes making popcorn so much easier and it pops just about every kernel this thing really works popping time about the same as in the microwave excellent never burns  makes perfect coffee roasted to perfection easy to use easy to clean would like more if dishwasher safe like the whirley pop but the material itself is rather thin love this product makes making popcorn a cinch does not have weight and is not sturdy at all makes great stove top popcorn and doesnt burn perfect fluffy popcorn every time makes the best popcorn ever best way to have popcorn best popcorn maker ever daughter loved it i love it used it a lot when 1st got it but not so much any more seems like its about 6 degrees off at temperatures below 100 but dead on otherwise i bought it to use brewing beer so i needed something a bit more accurate for controlling fermentation tempature however ive started using it as a standard kitchen thermometer and it works great there i would buy it again certainly for the price if i needed a kitchen thermometer or bbq thermometer but for a super accurate low temp thermometer look elsewhere also i tested it for freezer monitoring and it will not read below 35 degree fahrenheit i give it 4 stars since it does work well but not at the range i we hoping for i used this thermometer on a beautiful cut of brisket in the smoker it was taking longer than it should have to reach temperature for the proper smoking time i used the old fashioned analog thermometer to find out i had over cooked it by 15 degrees i was left with a delicious shoe you dont need two but this thing works so well you should buy two anyway it has been rained on twice and still works great very reliable and accurate at a good value easy to use simple unit works great love alarm as advertised worked very well the one time i used it but no longer works after washing the probe in the dishwasher i had one of these before that died after years of use and frequent washing in the dish washer solid roaster at a low price will cook at 15 lb turkey just because of the patterned surface on the bottom i wouldnt use this for any other kind of cooking since it could be harder to clean therefore it is less versatile than heaviergauge products would be also with a 15 lb bird there is not a lot of space for vegetables underneath like others have said this arrived damaged it was badly dented and the metal was flaking off i actually got a sliver when i ran my hand over it this is a poor quality product i used it for my very first homecooked thanksgiving turkey and it was a huge success i deeply recommend this product was better than i expected and a great buy just like my moms when i was younger works great lid is warped quality not good do not recommend perfect size for a single person good pan for roasting great roasting pan was a gift the new first response tests are awful please go back to the old ones last month i got 4 positive tests on the new ones and i wasnt pregnant it was very sad since i have been ttc im pretty sure im pregannt  today is my expected period my last period was december 2 and i injtially took a test on dec 21 and was definitely a negative i didnt have a problem using these and they were clear to read i had a good experience with these and would recommend them in my case i tested for a situation that was pretty much impossible to get my pregnant but i wanted to make sure due to a scheduled surgery and i was being paranoid price is good but these tests really werent i got lines on two of them they werent as clear as a positive would be but i can definitely see how they would be misinterpreted as being positive especially when upon taking the thing apart the second line had pink on the edges so it doesnt look like just an indent or an evap it looked like a positive i almost cancelled surgery over it but thankfully went through and a previous blood test confirmed i wasnt pregnant which i couldnt be anyway presurgery nerves did something to my mind but i bet you could dip these things into plain water and get that line and the indent line being visible even when you dont take it apart can make the test pretty confusing in short i wouldnt recommend these at all the windows for me werent stark white and the viewing window was hard to see since it catches a lot of glare i will say that i doubt a strong pink line would be an evap line mine was very faint it gets a 5 star because it came back neg work fine gave me my results takes quiiiiite awhile for the hour glass to load up my results but it gets the job done  bety good product and very dast delivery as advertised and swift delivery early sensitivity my family was ready to move from plastic storage to glass and i did my research tried the rubbermaid version and ordered the pyrex the description says each has its own sealtight blue plastic lid lets be clear while the lids do sit firmly on the bowl they are not leak proof in fact if the bowl is turned sideways liquid will pour out from under the lip of the lid time will tell how durable this set is for the time being im disappointed in the quality of the seal i works really well in storage my food i dont have so much time so i usually make a lot of food on sunday and use this one to storage my food on refrigerator these food storage also work well on microwave just be careful dont immediately make changes in temperature i usually get it out of my refrigerator for about 15 minutes before i put it into microwave to reheat my food is contained in it its pyrex thick glass matching lids my only concern is how easily the lid broke in shipment the 7x11 lid was under the glass dish it matched with it broke at seam hopefully they start packing these better they packed glass well but forgot about lids probably assuming theyd be fine otherwise seem okay currently cooking with the dish we shall see if it was more than just lid issue i typically purchase the standard plastic containers but tired of the stains from spaghetti sauce and other foods i love these containers thick and sturdy glass in various sizes i originally wanted the red lids however the blue is really nice delivery was quick and the packaging was great lots of protection against breakage these are nice sturdy storage pieces they are however much much smaller than i had originally anticipated i wouldnt have ordered if i had realized how small they actually are they are pyrex though so they are of great quality they are made of thick glass and have lids that fit well giving them a nice and secure closure i love this set and use it all the time so much better than the plastic ones and come out nicely clean in dishwasheralthough do not put the lids in too they are nicely sized with no too tiny ones you never use highly recommend this set for its quality and usefulness and nothing beats pyrex love these containers they seal very well and havent had a problem with any leaking liquids or the lids falling off while storing food in my backpack on the way to work they are pretty solid and feel heavy which makes them feel expensive i got them on a deal and it was very worth the money i paid this a great set for cold storage and reheating we replaced plastic containers that were staining and did not fare well on the microwave these glass containers store easy by nesting in themselves and the lids fit well and seal tight i recommend this product very versatile and great for everything from storage to good prep lids hold securely and air tight they also stack pretty well and dont slip when on top of one another cause the lids are quite grippy with proper care they will last forever as will most pyrex products its so convenient to be able to store food in the same dish it was cooked in i love this set these are solid glass baking dishes just as we have come to expect from pyrex the covers fit snugly and stack easily if needed nice variety of sizes for different needs very nice storage set that keeps food fresh for a long time pyrex is a brand i trust as ive dropped and clanged these dishes and they have not chipped or broke i recieved the pyrex 10 piece storage set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review very nice high quality i use these to store all my tomato based sauces as well as anything else that is acidic they wash up great there are no stains on these because of that they look so much nicer than my old plastic containers ever did after one use great and practical overall only downside is that while pyrex suggests that you use place the lid on top of the container when microwaving ive had one instance of the lid basically imploding  now the lid is deformed and doesnt work the way it sound variety of sizes use thse for everything didnt even bother buying bowls to go along with our plates as these were just fine its not as great as the old durable pyrex but have not have broken one and thyve been all over the range of sizes is exactly what i needed they store compactly nestled inside each other i put the lid on the bottom to separate the layers of glass microwave and dishwasher safe top rack for lids nice set at the price i love pyrex products and i needed a set like this with the price it was a great deal covers are boring blue color but i dont really mind that smaller than expected but good tight seal oven safe id buy a ton more and give 5 stars if there was a more stackable solution still not easy to organize you cant really go wrong with pyrex all but the largest rectangle one fit in my lunch bag comfortably otherwise great for food storage bought them for my girlfriend she loves them they are super stout and are all one color which my ocd girlfriend appreciates this is a very nice set of bowls from pyrex they are just the right size for leftovers and the dot pattern is cheerful too these are great leftover containers i bought 2 packages and replaced a lot of plastic containers these are a great buy pyrex is great quality but these are smaller than expected but the price is great for the brand i love pyrex and have never been disappointed in one of their products great set of containers the kids dont go on as easy as normal pyrex all sizes as quite small for the price who doesnt love pyrex and how amazing it is great purchase for the price pyrex is the best however i was a bit surprised by the sizes pretty small very handy containers for leftovers cant go wrong with polka dots lid melted in the microwave first time being cooked pass on these best purchase i made when i threw away all my plastic containers good price and nice product love glassware versus the plastic bad quality lids can not withstand the heat in the microwave i always buy pyrex for the quality and a good price arrived on time and assembled easily great product  works as advertised great price present for my mother great they come in very handy very useful and great quality good quality i love them not as big as i expected excellent pyrex product great price for this set just what i needed whats not to like love the bowls love my pyrex no complaints great storage great quality very sturdy love them love these excellent i love these i like them the ist one arrived  no lights workrd so sent it right back they sent a replacement and everything works but the clock light never lights up i wanted to send it back toobut my husband was sick of having no coffee so we kept it everything is great with it but i just get mad everytime i look at it  cant read the time sorry absolutely love love this programmable coffee maker makes great coffee  is well made highly recommend have owned this for years and it still works great love it simply put the best coffee maker on the market best coffee maker we have ever owned as expected arrived on time excellent works great so far ive used it to cut up cucumbers carrots lettuce tomatoes potatoes and a few other things with both thick and thin blades i havent had a problem with smushing tomatoes its pretty easy to set up and use right out the box ive had a few issues with uneven cuts but im pretty sure that its my fault since i hadnt used one before there are a couple reasons i took off one star theres no easy way to store this without keeping it in the box and even then its a pain to get everything to fit back in nicely one of the pictures shows a nice way to situate everything to store but i havent gotten that to work yet it would be nice if it had a bigger stand or something slicing over a cutting mat can be kind of a pain there is some waste with the way you use the slice and holder i got a safety glove which i would recommend anyway and its reduced the waste a lot since i can hold that last piece and slide it myself overall its a good purchase and would recommend i have one and use it a lot and got one for my daughter for christmas she is learning to use it as its very sharp and can get cut pretty bad if not careful it comes with a guard that really must be used  very nice very sharp ive had this mandoline slicer for about 7 years i use it all the time and it still cuts as good as the day i bought it this thing is great the cost is unbeliveable and it works great thin slices and i feel safe using it i use it for everything its easy to clean and cuts almost all veggies in less than a minute excellent product great product this was a present for my daughter i havent heard anything back about it so i dont know how she likes it this pillow while not the greatest in aesthetic quality is great i agonized over buying a costly pillow i wasnt sure would work but im so glad i did it does come with a slipcover sure its a bit flimsy but ive already removed it to wash it and it was fine for people who turn a lot i can see that this might be cumbersome to start but ive adjusted easily to simply pulling my knees up and then rotating and putting them down again for an easy middle of the night turn my favorite maternity purchase for sure and its already been useful when i babysat my niece 7mos as a bumper on my bed to prevent rolling so im excite to keep using it after maternity as well finally some relief i bought this pillow while laying in my hospital bed for 11 days for a compression fracture of the spine due to a fall i know that it seems that mostly pregnant women are using this pillow and i can certainly understand why but it is also a wonderful alternative for people with pain i also have fibromyalgia bursitis of the shoulder and osteoarthritis of the hips back and knees believe me i know what pain is and now due to this awesome pillow i finally have some relief i may just never want to get out of bed again being pregnant was great until the end of the second trimester i didnt even gain that much weight but the sheer size of my belly was just uncomfortable no matter what  until i laid on my left side in bed with my snoogle my boyfriend quickly grew jealous of my pillow when i started to really rely heavily pun intended on it for cuddling at night instead of him it held up to my weight and sweat 7 months pregnant in florida in the summer and i even took it with me to disney world my mom has sciatica and she absolutely loves this pillow granted she loves all pillows but this one is unlike her regular body is better because its nice and firm and actually gives her support it comes with a sheet that gives you different ideas on how to use the pillow its very versatile with many uses i have even seen her walking around her house with it wrapped around her body like a snake when she got it her dog got jealous of it so i think that says something my wife was really having a hard time getting comfortable at night during her pregnancy so after a ton of research we settled on this we didnt want something super massive to the point that i would essentially be sleeping on the floor this pillow is the perfect companion for our bed its not to big but yet it hits all the comfort points if you share a bed with someone and your bed is smaller than a queen this probably isnt the right pillow for you purchased for my fiance which was great during the first month but product did not even last 7 months by the time she was 8 months into her pregnancy the pillow was no longer fluffy and did not retain its shape in addition the pillow cover was not comfortable at all had to tailor pillow covers with other fabric because the covers offered by leachco were all rough which made the skin itch the material is nice and is soft my sister purchased this item when she was within her first trimester and she did not use it much during maybe the middle of her second trimester is when she began to use the snoogle she uses it at night when she goes to bed the only down side to the snoogle that my sister and brotherinlaw can think is the pillow cover once you take it off it can be difficult to put back on because the opening to the pillow cover is only at one end this means that you have to put the entire pillow cover back on from one end and pull the pillow through the cover all the way to the other end of the pillow we thought it would be better if maybe a zipper was involved just because it would be easier to put the cover back on the pillow overall it is still a very nice pillow my wife was not very impressed it doesnt really support your back at best it might just keep your back warm it is nice to have the pillow between the legs but you dont need a total body pillow for that she didnt like that she couldnt use her regular pillow for her head when using this it mostly just sits by the side of our bed this was my first pregnancy pillow purchase and i returned it for the jersey version this version has a weird cover that is super scratchy and uncomfortable the neck part was also diggy i dont have any problems with the jersey version though so if you are looking pay the couple extra dollars and get the jersey chic version of this pillow i didnt want to cave and get a pregnancy pillow because of the price but i am glad i did this pillow does not completely take away back pain while sleeping but it does make sleeping a whole lot more comfortable i use it every night and even during the day if i lay down on the floor highly recommend loved this product when i bought it last year when i had to buy a new one i was excited truly was an amazing product however im not sure if something has changed with the stuffing or what but this pillow now gives me terrible headaches i cant use it at all what a huge waste of  this pillow is completely worth it i started sleeping with my snoogle when i was about 56 months pregnant and found that i couldnt sleep without it even my husband has commented on how comfortable it is definitely worth it too hard and too big i would love it if it will allow me to use my own pillow but its too big and i have to use it as my pillow but it is too hard and high for me makes my neck stiff in the morning i really hate it i thought i would love this but it takes up so much space it is like having a third person in bed with us i also think i may be a little tall for it i am 6 feet tall so it is hard to get comfortable around 18 weeks i was started becoming uncomfortable while sleeping and this helped tremendously i suggest buying the jersey cover for it the original cover is a bit rough feeling on your skin i love this pillow i have used it for two pregnancies and one major surgery its a life saver especially with last trimester does need the jersey cover to make it really comfortable though very comfortable and durable i could sleep with it by hugging the pillow as well as using it as back support if i want to roll over all i can say is i wish i had bought this item earlier really helped with my sleep issues great product at a great price thanks absolutely love it im only in my first trimester and it really helps support my back without it i cant sleep on my side this pillow is awesome super comfy and works well i love it so much and so does my husband who likes to steal it from me bought for my pregnant daughter loved it so much she bought another comfortable and supportivesleeps like a rock great if you dont move around much in bed but for me i needed something i could roll with and this was way to large i bought it to help with back pain while pregnant and ended up loving it more for nursing in bed absolutely worth it i recommend this pillow to everyone pregnant or not pregnant im finally getting a good night sleep great buy my wife loves this pillow and unfortunately will no longer snuggle with me it is a must for any pregnant woman good pillow a shame it is made in that shape and you cant make it straight since it gets a little uncomfy if pregnant or having back issues this pillow is ideal it is the only pillow i need during my pregnancy almost like having a boyfriend says my wife i think she was joking anyway shes happy my wife didnt like this product at first glance but as soon as she slept with it she was in love i love my snoogle this quickly turned into a pregnancy essential for me cant sleep without it cant leave without this pillow either side of it is super comfy during sleep worth every penny thing is super comfy got it for my pregnant wife and ended up using it for my sciatica as well if you want your wife to stop cuddling you at night when its time to sleep buy this for her i bought it for my sister who is pregnant she used it the first night and said she loved it i had so much trouble sleeping and this has completely eliminated my discomfort this was my best friend when i was pregnant it helped me sleep more comfortable the best pregnancy pillow out there its not too fat so its easy to cuddle with bought this for my daughter she loves it would be nice to have an extra cover had a lot to chose from but in the end im glad i chose this one i love it bought this for my daughter and she is loving it fast shipping my wife loved this pillow through her 2nd and 3rd trimesters been using it 5 months and cant imagine sleeping without it my lady loves this pillow happy wife happy life lol best gift for expecting moms easy to wash i can not without this pillow when i sleep so uncomfortable  and too big somebody do not like it very comfortable love it returned thanks great difficult to put on impossible for me needs larger opening possibly with zipper or velcreo this is a fun product i did confuse joseph with one of the wisemen for a short period of time look for the one not holding anything the noise is not to loud and it doesnt last long which is helpful any of the pieces fit on top which makes it even more fun for the children it is very simple to assemble also i got this for my niece and she loved it played with it for quite some time before getting distracted she came back to this toy a lot through out the day this is a great way for children to have a nativity that they can play with while parents have the untouchable kind this was so perfect with a 2 year old and a 4 year old i needed something that they would be allowed to play with i remember growing up and always wanting to play with the set my parents had we were never allowed to touch our s and it was torture lol this one is so cute and fun for the kids the book that you can buy in addition to this is also great my kids had a blast reenacting the book with the characters this was brand new and priced better than most sites i looked at i think my daughter was more thrilled than my grandson but he will always have his own nativity scene to handle and learn to appreciate what it represents my grandchildren loved it they had been picking up the pieces of my nativity scene so i got them one of their own they loved picking up the pieces and moving them around without the worry of dropping or breaking it i gave as a gift to my sister with a little girl a great product to have with little kids they have a nativity set to play with and you have ones that dont get broken my 2 year old loves her lp nativity scene she has learned the christmas story well after playing with this throughout the christmas season love it great quality the kids love playing with it so much they were sad to see all the characters get packed up in the christmas box until next year good little set but comes with a lot of pieces which inevitably end up all over our living room floor price for the value is good super cute put out as a xmas decor for the holiday but my grandson loves it so much im keeping it out we loved sharing the christmas story with our toddler grandchildren thank you loved the nativity set and it was delivered when promised its so cute and my granddaughters love it great quality my son loved this our grand daughter just loved it wonderful gift for every child nothing wrong with the replacement but after 3 years of using the blades it came with my shaving experience did not change whatsoever by getting new blades the only difference is that i feel like the shaver is working a little harder or theres a little less noise but no shaving or cutting improvement the heads themselves or ok the shipping time was ok the price however went up 5 in the past year thats 25 in one year that is too much since i bought the razor i have little choice bugs me though first time buying for bazinga treading a amazon talk about your quick response and shipping and im not a priority customer price was very reasonable and i am a 5 star happy customer super product the razor is over five years old and still works well the phillips catalog is confusing hard to pick the correct replacement heads this is the second time ive purchased this replacement head buy one every year or so and your shaver will be like new']"

since i am always on the go my wife always really liked them and we ordered a second set to replace her flimsy less quality bands thanks black mountain for producing a great product at a fraction of what other competitors are selling them for i just got this set yesterday as well as a set from another company so i could compare the quality the other set seems to be made pretty well but these from black mountain are higher quality the nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look ive been using resistance bands for years not as my sole resistance routine but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they havent as they are very effective as these eventually wear out as they all do in time ill replace them with black mountain products again my only complaint is there is a slip of paper that came with the bands offering me a free orange band but the phone number given doesnt seem to connect to anything my husband uses these and finds them to be good for his arthritis stretching exercises i got these for christmas and have been using them multiple days a week since the resistance is great i would agree that the low resistance is pretty worthless but maybe some use it i was a little skeptical about the customer service given the review but i called to inquire about these before purchase and they answered right away which gave me a little more confidence so far so good i will let you know if there are any issues with the bands themselves after continue usage between 34xwk havent had it long enough to use all of the components but so far im impressed with the quality of the material i also really like the fact that you can remove and mixmatch the bands using the hooks on each end all in all so far so good and they do what theyre meant to do will update once i can try the other exercise positions using the door anchor im not a weight guy and ive tried resistance bands in the past and was never that impressed this product is great it doesnt have that flimsy cheap feel it feels solid and offers good resistance and is easy to use ive used it now for a while and i will keep on using it instead of throwing it in some drawer to gather dust i would highly recommend this product for both beginners and veterans and it is compact enough to take with me on trips i love this product upon first receiving it i was skeptical that these would provide a good workout but i can assure you after doing a little 10 minute workout found on youtube these little bands deliver i was so sore after just a short workout i highly recommend this product to anyone considering a home exercise product to keep themselves fit excellent packaging the whole set fits neatly into the carrying bag excellent for travel the bands appear to be of superior quality when compared to spri connecters work well as does the door mount stacking the bands is easy and quality control has ensured that the bands are of consistent length awesome purchase received these as a gift construction seems pretty legit i like the carabiners vice plastic clips of competitors the handles and other attachment points feel quality perfect to stay on track while traveling and cant take the weights with me would recommend this product and company to friends and family alot of bang for the buck effective work out without the hassles of changing weight and buying expensive equipment best of all you can take it with you when traveling it comes with a carrying case and has an instruction manual which clearly shows the different exercises and how to set up what is needed good for a light workout it is very portable gives you more variety of exercises you can do and takes up much less space then a set of dumbells the bands are sturdy and the connections at the end are solid and seem well made overall a very good value as long as you arent looking for real heavy lifting i purchased these bands to help restrengthen after shoulder surgery and have been very happy with them quality is excellent its fast and easy to change the handles from one band to another and the carrybag has made it easy to take these with me wherever i might travel highly recommended they tore up after a little over a year and im not very strong poor quality also one of the handle got bent but you can still work out with it when they tear it can be painful so i suggest if you must buy this brand replace every year these were perfect for my home gym easier to store and move than dumbbells and significantly cheaper the handles and door frame loop are advantages over traditional bands and make them feel more like gym machines than exercise bands great product  i dont have time to go to the gym and this product is very good because i can take it anywhere i just started using it with my p90x and it works very well im happy with this product and would recommended to anyone bought this for use while i was in physical therapy and am pretty happy with it for convenience factor it can be cumbersome though when having to switch out different bands over an hour or hour and a half of working with them good set of resistance training equipment my wife and i both use it its easy to use and comes with an easy to read guide and is well made and well thought out small package stores easily just about anywhere my item arrived exactly as advertised so far im pleased with my purchase the bands seen well made and sturdy and easy use and switch out the carrying bag is a plus as it nearly holds everything nice and neatly these are awesome i love that i can exercise at home and that this equipment is small enough to just tuck away when im done the anchor is the best part as all you need is a door and your good to go great set i have been using these bands for about 2 months and they are great i had double shoulder and bicep surgery this year and these bands are perfect for my at home exercises prescribed by my physical therapists i use mine for physical therapy it is truly a well manufactured product i think the price is right considering the level of excellent constructioni rarely give a 5 star but in this case they deserve it great product i love the fact that you can clip multiple bands together for increased resistance they are great for a quick workout during a work break highly recommended this is the best set of resistance bands on amazon at an amazing price they offer great resistance and provide you with plenty of exercises that you can use these bands for really great quality equipment i used them as soon as i received and was very happy received as promised packaged well and a nice note from the company  great touch these are awesome they work very well and i would

quality of the rubber band is not vey good easy to use booklet full of workout routines love this product good quality and price great resistance band set for starters perfect meet all my needs great for use anywhere good but not for me works well for me good quality all good  i bought this kit 2 winters ago we have a ranch house on the side of a mountain and it gets very cold combine that with really crummy old windows and our house was freezing not good when you pay for home heating oil it was so bad at one point that when it was windy outside i actually witnessed the drapes in my house billowing into the room that is when i decided to purchase this kit i actually got 2 kits to make sure i could finish all the windows in my house and i ended up having plenty left over i installed the double sided tape and stuck on the plastic used the blowdryer to warm it up and shrink wrap the windows and i was done no more draft or chilly rooms you are supposed to take it off after each winter but i have left it on for 2 years now i find it also keeps my house cooler in the summer combined with thermal drapes you have a combination for energy savings pros  sticks great and lasts for a long time once you get the hang of it its easy to install really has saved us money on home heating oil cons  if you dont totally shrink the plastic you can see the ripples from the outside of the house and it looks a little messy but if you do it right it is crystal clear it is awfully hard to get the double stick tape off if you leave the product up for a long time we are now going into our third winter with the same kit on our windows and we are only now noticing some of the windows are losing their plastic in some places peeling etc but thats to be expected when its only supposed to be left on for a shorter period of time my apartment has a front living room with three windows that let in very cold air in winter so i moved my living room into the middle dining room i keep the door between the two rooms open enough for my cats to get through i rarely go in the front room in winter because its so cold my friend helped me install this insulator which turned out to be very easy just apply the doublesided tape around the frame attach the plastic and then blow dry with heat to tighten the plastic i can barely even see the insulating plastic the only problem is that i had to decide if i wanted the window blinds up or down because the plastic covers the entire window casing you will not be able to use your blinds or shades just drapery ive lived here in erie pa seven years and ive wasted so much money on gas when i moved from the front room to the middle room and kept the door between the two ajar instead of wide open i reduced my monthly gas budget from 98 to 72 now that i have this product my monthly amount is 42 unbelievable this is a great product to prevent leaky windows from succeeding in letting cold air inside the tape holds well when the outdoor wind blows please read exercise patience measure twice before you cut the film and allow for an extra inch dont skimp or you will regret it read trying to pull too tight when mounting and risk not fitting or tear of film glad i bought one extra box to learn from mistakes and not have to wait endure more cold i like that visibility outside is not compromised i love this product we have an old house and a lot of leaks around the windows this significantly changes the room temperature it increased the warmth of the room significantly it took us one window to figure out the technique for putting it into place and once we got the technique down it was very easy to put in place use the hair dryer at the end to tighten up the material and you are good to go will be using this for every winter from here on out for the cold chicago winters great product seals great and definitely makes a huge difference in temperature my heat kicks on less often depending on window size you can sometimes get more than 3 windows out of it most important step not to skip is making sure your window sill is clean if its not the insulator tape is not going to stick and cold air will seep in what a waste of money first off let me state that is product may work if you ever get it applied to he window after multiple applications trying to center a giant sheet of saran wrap around super sticky tape i am probably qualified to fuel jets mid air this product is beyond infuriating perhaps a team of 4 would have no issues my brother installed these for me he used a hot blower gun sort of like a hair dryer and it shrunk it so that i cannot even tell that there is plastic over my windows seriously they are invisible i can tell already that it will keep my daylight basement warmer  i highly recommend this such a simple solution and it really works older home not able to afford fancy new windows i immediately put this on my worst problem window and its made a big difference helped keep the room much warmer my girlfriends room is above the garage so we insulated the windows to cut down on the cold air getting in it definitely helped super easy to use never needed to use a window insulating kit before but was pleasantly surprised at how much it helped the draft coming from my windows for us it did not work we couldnt get tape to stick nor plastic to shrink for us this wasnt a good buy and we needed up using duck tape lol reallt easy to use great to cover the windows to keep out the cold air this comes w double sided tape to help gm\\xc3\\x84\\xc2\\xa3  do be careful using pressure to smooth the film when sticking it if you rub it with your fingernails you can tear it easy to apply  kind of fun watching it contract when using the blow dryer does a great job keeping the cold air old good for keeping the cold out measure first and clean the surface properly used for camp sticky tape didnt work yeah im pretty happy about 3ms whole system of these no matter what size there is a bit of a learning curve to get them to lay flat but thats life kids ive been using them for the past 2 years and i live in chicago i cant verify due to changing weather temps if ive saved money on my heating bill but id like to think so its well worth the price of them and i definitely notice the drafts stopped the windows are always icing up from condensation once it gets below 32\\xc2\\xba ive tried ceiling fans to keep the air flowing but to no avail these window films do the trick every time no more icing up no more water from condensation on my window sills no more mold growth from the moisture buy them put them up and stay warm all season easy to use worked great there are not 5 different sheet of material for 5 windows rather there is one large sheet that you have to cut into 5 pieces to make it work for 5 windows otherwise its a fine product it did a perfect job of keeping the cold air out around our ac so that we did not have the hassle of removal and storage this is the first time i used 3m window insulation and istallation was a breeze the scotch tape held like a champ and the plastic is so clear that if you give it good heat from the hair dryer it almost feels like there is nothing in front of window highly recommended for the cold weather our heat is off for good few hours during the day and night i purchased this fire extinguisher in 2001 and it has sat on my kitchen counter ever since on march 17th 2012 my next door neighbor was outside his house and very foolishly poured gasoline from a full 25gallon container onto a pile of hot smoldering wooden logs of course the can exploded and it landed against the outside of his 2story house the house is wood frame house with painted wood siding at this point he was on fire so he rolled on the ground to put himself out he ended up with 3rd degree burns but his next action was to get up and come find me i was working outside raking leaves when i heard him screaming by this time the fire is raging against the outside of his house the flames were about 810 wide against the side of his house and touching the top of his 2nd story gutter as he was panicking and calling 911 i quickly retrieved the small kiddie fire extinguisher from my kitchen and ran towards the blaze at this point i am thinking i am shooting a bbgun  read more these should be in every car there is no reason not to have one on you even just driving in a city and daily commuting it could mean the difference in saving a car or a life i have 2 in my jeep especially when off roading purchased after a crazy nye night where it took two of the things to put out trash can fire in the garage must have for any middle aged man wanting to save face while putting out fires from used fire works in a garbage can great fire extinguisher for a great price but came with a broken wall strap making it impossible to secure to the wall very disappointing maybe it was on the shelf too long and the plastic got brittle ever since there was a fire in our neighborhood i started making all the precautions to prevent fire and thats why ive been buying these fire extinguishers well never when we would need to use it can never have too many safety items at home or in your car or in your office you wont be putting out forest fires with these but its a nice thing to have if not for the ease of mind it offers i havent had to use it yet however just having it makes me feel safer for having it honestly for the price everyone should get one for a just in case situation while it hasnt had to be used i am sure it does its job as it feels like a substantial product the price was less than a lot of hardware stores appears to be a solid built fire extinguisher but fortunately i havent had to use it and i hope i never will arrived fully charged neatly packed and with a wall hanging unit fits under kitchen sink too the fire extinguisher was fully discharged upon opening the package it was a mess outstanding product the price and freaky fast delivery  it is good to have in your home this old man is not taking any chances this is a need to your home good item for the household bought as a gift this is defective and does not work it is unbelievable that defective safety equipment is being sold still available for purchase and that more effort is not being made to warn people who bought it great this is the perfect brush for cleaning hydroflasks i previously used baby bottle brushes to do so but i find that this ones better i purchased this bottle scrubber to clean the glass water bottles i have because i dont feel they come super clean from the dishwasher this brush works fine for one of my bottles but the bristles are more stuff than i hoped for and its not flexible the brush is good quality though and feels like it will last a very long time fits into nooks and crannies of bottle and breast pump parts which has greatly assisted efficient cleaning 4star rating because for these purposes the handle and neck are a bit long and there is no stand the brush is a bit more awkward to store in the kitchen otherwise a great product that is priced well perfect brush for my nalgene bottles gets into the wide mouth and the smaller water bottle sized mouth once this one gets wrecked from vigorous cleaning ill be sure to pick up another i use it to wash out our soda stream bottles and it works great this is the second time i purchased this product as i used the first one to the end of its lifespan perfect length and quality product i use it to clean my growing collection of swell bottles good length as it reaches the bottom of the 24oz swell got this to clean my soda stream bottles and its the perfect size super soft bristles and the wand part fo the handle is nicely flexible great for glasses also use the brush on sensitive pans to avoid scratching looking for a brush like this one for other pans and dishes lasted about a month for cleaning the water bottle i bought worked well and i felt good that my water bottle was good and clean the handle could be a little more sturdy but otherwise i like this product it reaches and cleans bottles from inside very well one of the best bottle brushes ive used works wonderfully to clean out our nalgene 1000ml water bottles was left in hot water in the sink and deformed the bristles cannot get them to return to shape the sturdy bristles scrub well and fit through most openings and the handle is a good length brush works great with the hydro flask i will buy another one of these for other uses so far great more of 8 weeks of usage and no problems at all recommended excellent brush for use with an oxo electric tea kettle made mostly with glass totally awesome means of washing the inside of your sport drinking bottle stained surprisingly easily which leaves it looking dirty all the time would buy again or give as gift great for cleaning hard to get places the handle is a bit short otherwise its a good product works great i think i have used it around a year good tool but wish the bristles were more tough nice quality been taken over by everyone else nice brush but would prefer stiffer bristles good product fast shipping excellent buy nice soft brush good for nonstick pans perfect for cleaning my swell bottles good grip non shedding bottle brush great for tight spots cleans well great price good little brush cleans my mason jars well use it and it works well works as expected quality product as expected works decent super cheap very sturdy dont work perfect works nice perfect perfect i checked the product details and the packaging mine arrived in is different from what is advertised the advertised packaging specifically says it is the only original us packaging and yet mine was completely different in shape form and design this problem is in addition to the fact that the infuser displayed wear and tear symptomatic of use despite the fact that it was purchased new i like the design but the quality is so bad i used it about 5 days a week the chain was detached at the third time well thats not a big deal but it got so much metal rusti thought its tea stains but not whitin one month i dont feel safe it doesnt close properly and the loose leaf tea i use always comes out into the water and i have to pick a lot of it out i will definitely be looking for a better one crap when closed still has massive gaps so all but the largest tea pieces float out might as well dump loose leaf tea right into your water it would be just as good for the money i really cant complain about this tea ball the only thing is that it doesnt shut all the way so every cup of tea has lingering loose leaves within it easy clasp to open and hook to latch onto cup handle they also tell you how much tea for each cup which was handy for me as i am new to the loose leaf game these bags are awesome first time shopping for reusable bags and i picked a winner even checkers have asked me where i got them love them \\xc2\\xbb great practical stainless steel mesh ball perfect size and the material doesnt leave any taste in the beverage i would recommend it been using regularly for months and it is still in like new condition no issues with tea leaves falling out while steeping i bought to make large portions of loose leaf tea but the leaves fall out of the sides and into my tea so i rarely use it lost the lip clip the link at the loose end of the chain after maybe 3 days worked great up to that point ive been using this product very reliably for many years and only now has it started to rust great product its awesome quality and has been a great companion for my tea  clasp broke off after a couple months rendering it unusable broke after a few uses very flimsy shipping was slow product did not work at all  i am very disappointed i buy loose teaworks like a charmeasy to clean rusty and hard to clean after a few uses high quality and it works as it should easy to use works well easy to clean broke before it made it to my mug well made and sturdy works great it was awkward working with this works with leaf tea great small very bad material great item fast delevery works really good wonderful product good product works great breaks fast perfect love it love it good i love it watching the tea spread from it is lovely makes having tea a little bit nicer i couldnt live without this tool in my kitchen i am zesting and grating regularly and having a microplane in easy reach is an essential i have several styles of microplanes for grating different things and different sizes but this is the one i use the most for limes lemons oranges etc fits right in the dishwasher when i am done and is always sharp and useful this was a replacement for one that i had had for many years and it had finally gotten a little dull but after ten years of essentially daily use i guess it was allowed to be not so sharp microplane is a great grater we bought this planer on the advice of our daughter whose kitchen philosophy is have a few gadgets but make them high quality this grater planer works very well i typically use it to zest lemons or to grate parmesan cheese it does both jobs perfectly and is easy to clean nowi buy cheese in a block which is better cheaper and keeps longer so this has become one of my favorite kitchen tools i use it to easily grate down garlic into a fine consistency that almost melts into soups and sauces its also perfect for getting the zest off of lemons or oranges its a delightfully versatile tool that is absolutely worth it this microplane is fantastic and i use it every day great for mincing garlic zesting lemons or limes grating cheese etc have bought additional ones for friends and family  great buy a must have  if you need a zester so easy to use and makes fast work of citrus peel you can quickly add citrus zest and clean up is so easy storage of this slim item is easy too love these i purchased one for myself a while back and loved it so much i got one for each of my daughters its reasonably priced and the quality is very nice as well weve had this for two years so many other microplaners fell apart but this one is great and we use it all the time i only wish it were slightly easier to clean i love this microplane we use it mostly for citrus zest and parmasen cheeses on our pastas its dishwasher safe it can be sharp though so be careful the first few times i used it i ended up with a little bit too much finger in my finger food if you know what i mean watch yourself love this zester it give me the type of zest i need without it being mush very well made an not hard to clean really works and is perfect for my receipes that call for a bit of lemon lime ginger etc zest larger than i thought it would be and had a larger shaving than i wanted\\xc2\\xb6 it dose work well perfect exactly what i was looking for perfect for zesting lemons or shredding nutmeg best grater ever super fine grateperfect for fruit

problems i have one got this for my nieceshe was thrilled wonderful accessory use it regularly great quality exactly what i needed and the quality is great worked great with the unit and easy to clean works better than a way more expensive one works great for venison great the key to a good coffee or spice grinder is a nonoval nonelliptical interior that kicks the spice into the blades krups adds a flat side to the cap interior so it does this and grinds well but krups makes the cap from a cheap brittle plastic that spontaneously cracks from normal use i patched the first crack but others kept coming  there are already five after three months of use  and this means that cap will sooner rather than later break apart see photo amazons price was 1999 but i bought mine at bed bath and beyond with a coupon that brought the price to 1500 pros cheap powerful motor and blades cons uneven grind smallish capacity if youre looking for a coffee grinder i wouldnt recommend a bladed one especially if you care about using the right size grind for the right drink blade grinders are cheap but a burr grinder ensures a uniform grind which is important to get a consistent flavor and brew this grinder however would be perfect for spices and i would actually recommend using it only for that cleaning is relatively easy just use a damp paper towel to wipe up the remains and a dry one to finish the job i got this for my parents who love coffee they didnt really like this product and actually went back to their old coffee grinder something about how the beans werent grinded up too well or something so im guessing this product isnt really for coffee addicts this thing can grind it has ground up everything i have placed in it with ease now the bad stuff the unit is really really hard to clean the only way to keep it clean is to wash it after every use i use it to grind up foods i have dehydrated it has powdered up sweet peppers carrots kale beets lime ginger and turbinado sugar so after each use i had to clean it up it was a big chore due to not having any napkins i bought a brush to clean it but it isnt the best thing and you will need to put some water in it to get the dust out from the bottom of the blade the unit does seem to be waterproof but i am not trying to find out it did shoot water out from the lid so i learned really fast to only place a small amount in there at a time as to allow the particles stuck under the blade to remove themselves the unit itself is surprisingly heavy after a few uses it stopped working but with a few shakes it would turn on i believe it stopped working due to the lid not being down all the way i want to process coffee beans at least once to see the end results but from my experience i dont know how anyone could get anything but a fine grind it seems to powder everything in seconds in seconds you can see powder forming on the lid i have no idea how i would get a coarse grind with the krups maybe the result is different with coffee beans than with dehydrated food i imagine i would have to pulse it for no longer than a second this is exactly what i was looking for though in the end so i give it 5 stars replaced a really old grinder of similar type by cusinart this one works great and i like it since it has a larger capacity for beans so i can grind more at once of course the grind depends on how long you hold the button down i like mine ground fine for an espresso machine some powder tends to cake under the blades i have developed a habit of holding it up when i push the button and tilt it sideways back and forth during grinding to facilitate mixing one would do well to count the seconds for the grind you like so to be more consistent over time i believe it takes about 10 seconds to get to a fine enough grind after done i put the gound coffee into a small can making a day or twos worth at one time so it is always fresh one needs to use their finger or another object to get the caked product out of the bottom but it is not a big deal it is easy to clean with a paper towel around the inside tapping the remainder out i found a small brush which i use to get grind out of the crevasses overall i find it is a great value and works well for small portions i buy and use whole spices from a health food store it is fresher and cheaper than packaged spices on the grocery shelves it allows me the flexibility to purchase exact amounts for a particular recipe without wasting the unused portions instead of buying individual spice mills i wanted one mill that could do all types of grinding coarse or fine i went to americas tedt kitchen website to read their reviews this product was 5 star rated knowing i could trust their experience and review i purchased the mill it livesup to its claim it has a removable cup for easy pouring and cleaning its the only spice mill i need and yes it does awesome with coffee beans nuts etc i highly recommend this product it is easy quick and produces an even grind on a mission to replace my last coffee bean grinder i spent considerable time reading reviews of the toprated ones i finally decided on this one big mistake the krups f203 does indeed grind coffee beans but trying to transfer the grounds to one\\xc3\\xa2s coffee maker results in a huge mess i wouldn\\xc3\\xa2t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices but it\\xc3\\xa2s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans summary i quit grinding coffee beans shortly after i started using this grinder thanks to this purchase i\\xc3\\xa2m back to buying preground coffee gimme my old grinder back recommendation against all reviews do not buy this is my first ever coffee grinder and i chose this one because of the low cost and the compact design it has been fantastic addition to our kitchen we have fresh ground coffee every day so delicious it is incredibly easy to use not too noisy and so compact i can tuck it away in the corner and it takes up no space my only complaint is that it is fairly easy to spill some on the counter when opening the top after youre done grinding im not sure if this is a universal problem with grinders or the design of this one i just try to be extra careful to minimize spillage so happy i chose this grinder when you are looking for a grinder you do not realize how important they are until you get this one then you grind your first cup of beans and omg this little machine is unbeatable it is like the ferrari of grinders 5 seconds and you have a perfect ground blend ready to make your day start off with a bang i used some in the military that actually stunk they were slow got stuck not this one this one takes a mundane task and makes it extra ordinary i will use a krups for the rest of my life no doubt about it grinding cup is not removable and product is difficult to clean  i have to turn the grinder upside down and tap with a spoon to get the ground coffee out of the grind chamber and there is a reside of coffee left on the lid as well as the chamber you cannot adjust the grind and the top can be difficult to remove at times i have to use a damp paper towel to clean the unit every time i use it which is a pain pros easy to use compact design reasonably priced cons this should only be used for grinding spices i do not suggest using this for coffee you will not get a consistent texturegrain size buy a burr grinder for your coffee beans instead difficult to clean the blade fully especially underneath the blade youll have to use a pipe cleaner or a thin piece of fabric i have had this on my wish list for a while and got this for christmas from my fathernlaw we both love coffee and love the strange brews from all over the world i have a different coffee maker than he does so this will come in great use when i give him coffee i ground my first batch already i didnt grind the whole bag because that will ruin the flavr of the bean bought this one to replace an earlier model that id been using since 1978 the earlier model still worked well but it looked awful after years of use and some accidents i expect this model will last as long  it certainly does the job well i detect no loss of quality from the earlier model i use mine for grinding spices and just occasionally for grinding coffee beans this is great i bought 3 bags of whole bean coffee online by mistake and didnt want to return them so i bought this grinder its fast easy to use and the cleanup is simple i dont know how long this sort of appliance usually lasts but regardless its cheap enough that i wouldnt mind replacing it after a few years wonderful buy this works well for small quantities it actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder which has several settings that said this grinds finely so if you need a coaster grind this may not be ideal it arrived in proper packaging and has been in use for nearly a year and still performs wonderfully this is a pretty good coffee grinder but coffee tends to pack around the edges of the inside requiring a utensil to scrape the coffee out also if youre doing a fine grind its sometimes hard to get very fine unless you fill it at least 23 but generally works well and no problems with the motor strong little grinder and works as you would expect the issues are with the actual lid to get the foodcoffee from the top you will ned to turn the whole thing upside dow and pat the machine to get it all out without a huge mess not a big deal but that great of a design i bought this for grinding dried peppers for jerky and curry making the grinder works great and youll get very fine powder be careful though as the dust can get in the air quite easily and like me youll be end up with a runny nose sneezing for 15 minutes or so oops this makes a huge mess coffee grinds everywhere need a brush to get them out grinds get compacted under the blades and will not come out unless you use a brush and then it becomes a mess i am shopping for something else do not buy this love this spice grinder it works on everything literally plus when i have to grind coffee beans occasionally for relatives the smell doesnt linger inside afterward as long as i clean it well with a wet cloth no complaints this grinder works very well with the regular filter coffee makers i found the grounds were too small for my reusable kcup which may just mean a new kcup would do the trick however the quality of this product is great bought this for my husband for christmas and he just loves it its incredibly easy to use one button operation easy to clean as well plus it makes the kitchen smell great while its grinding coffee beans  small and powerful not much else to be said here i just wish it did a better job of uniformly grinding the beans other than that this thing works flawlessly a little messy but its coffee whadyagonado so far so good i initially bought a hand grinder  ceramic type to keep the coffee as pure as possible but i found that it was taking way too long to grind this is a good fast solution this is a nice simple little grinder you cant grind huge batches of coffee at a time but thats fine for us i havent used it for spices yet but im sure it will work great when i do this product is excellent its inexpensive and made with quality its a great coffee grinder there are no fancy settings you control the type of grind manually but its very easy use i purchased this to replace a coffee grinder that i previously had for 10 years i have used this for coffee and spices works great runs smoothly and quietly yikes the current model is made in china and fills the room with a very pungent electricity smell and does not have the power my old krups grinder had do not buy excellent tool we had it for over a year with no problems does a good job grinding coffee does not heat the grounds too much and keeps the oils and flavores in i bought this for my son and he loves it it grinds the coffee beans perfectly and fast he really likes the fact this grinder also grinds spices too nice fine grounds does a great job these units usually dont last more than a year time will tell if this holds true for this unit we own two of these one for spices and one for coffee they work great and are super easy to clean we just use a little bit of dried rice my first time ever using this or grinding coffee so easy coffee is so much better and fresher i love this size because its only for me grinds well quiet but the lid leaves a little to be desired it is long and fits inside causing beans and grounds to cling to the sides i love this product its small so its easy to store its quick and efficient and not very loud and i got it for a great price i use this to pulverize my dehydrated hot peppers from my garden grinds them into the finest dust just what i needed i just needed to grind my own coffee as i am becoming a coffee snob this seems to do well but i am just learning so i use it every morning works great i put 8 tbsp of coffee beans in it takes about 10s to turn them into a fine powder since i bought it i have used it almost everyday the only problem is that the coffee ground sticks to the container does the job perfectly nice shape for pouring directly into coffee maker once chopped great price recommend highly great grinder for coffee durable replaces our old braun grindersimple one function grind no bells or whistles this was my first attempt at grinding i was not impressed functioned sufficiently but not as fine as id hoped basic coffee grinder not very loud grinds beans perfectly use daily clean with a small unused makeup brush just purchased and i really like it so far its super simple design and low noise makes for a great grinder  perfect and powerful just what i needed to get the most nutrients out of the nutsayay i am in love thanks i grind spices and nuts with ease  even grind oats to make flour  this is the best kitchen tool yet  works perfectly as advertised used for the freshest coffees taste and aroma grinds spices well too worked extremely well on dried muscadine grape seeds was very happy with our ground flax seeds cheap works well this little thing is dependable and perfectly grinds my coffee beans love this grinder high quality and grinds perfectly very happy with this product been griding coffee for a year without any problems makes for a nice even grind this works great for me i found no need of a timer and the grind is perfect after a couple of months doesnt grid beans well big pieces in grids been using to grind my chaga to put in a tea bag works like a charm good grinder works well but is somewhat hard to clean quick ship strong motorgrinds coffee very quickly and effectively turns whole beans into fresh ground coffee excellent grinder small solution to grinding coffee with less counter space wonderful simple works very well and very good value use this to cut corners prepping in the restaurant good purchase very satisfied with the quality a year and half later still works great it grinds evenly but its capacity is less works well enough for its price no issues works really really well as expected first one returned due to burning smell essential for good living i love it great gift loved it arrived fast works great used as a spice mill used it for years and its great so far so good after 3 months ive been using it a lot very quick and efficient grinds coffee perfectly powerful work good nice worked great works as expected now thats coffee perfect grinder great product wife loves it great grinder great product does the job works great great value it grinds perfect bad really great product i use it for spices coffee truvia it makes it into a fine powder love it this is a christmas present to someoneso do not have like or dislike yet it works well but the container is too small for us end up returning it i had the same problem that others on amazon are having with this product who likely left bad reviews as im doing here right now i just purchased this same filter from walmart recently along with a brand new brita water pitcher yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each otherand the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well i thought i was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing and watching the dirty water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir i just cringed and scratched my head after triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly i pushed so darn hard that i was ready for the unit to break the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housingand alas water still leaks through and the filter clearly does not seal well with this unit i find it almost humorous that i only came here to read these amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after i decided to google my problem and see if there was a magic solution and i see brita repeatedly replying with were sorry call our customer service and we will helpor you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down if you go onto britas website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there you will also find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass throughalong with the same sad responses from brita support which seemingly makes brita look like theyre being proactive unfortunately as in this case sometimes replying with the same canned responses that dont really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well clearly brita is in denial or wont publicly accept fault for this issue i think the worst part in all of this though is that there are likely many consumers who get their new brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old brita filters worked and they dont even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesnt seal properlycompletely in a watertight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus so all of the great things brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this youre buying a filter to clean your water you dont even notice its not cleaning your water and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightlylessdirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesnt seal well the essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter all of the water not just most of itif the product cant filter 9999999 of the water being poured into it then it is most certainly a defective product giving the benefit of the doubt to brita that they arent purposely and knowingly selling a defective filterdesign its still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isnt lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters fyi brita customer service if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly properly and easily sealed when insertedthen i know you havent read or care about what i say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue no need for me to call brita customer service either im going to buy a filter now from your competitor and i can only hope it works the way it should thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your ceo and coo and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet i bought my brita pitcher years ago and the filters looked different when i first bought it so i was nerves that my pitcher was too old and it would not fit but it was no problem since these filters fit perfectly the top of these filters look different it has a thinner top i love it because it is easier to grab and take out of the pitcher the old filters i had to struggle with to get out sometimes i had to disassemble to top of the pitcher and push the filter from underneath these new filters seem to get rid of that problem also there is barely any presoaking required i got these out of the package expecting to soak them in a bowl for several hours but the instructions said to just rinse it for a few seconds so no more having to get a bowl out for filter replacements the quality of the water is good too i don\\xc3\\xa2t notice any difference in the quality of water from the old filters the price is reasonable i got a five pack for 2456 this comes out to under 13 cents per gallon if i use the recommended 40 gallons per filter i use these filters in my brita pitcher to transfer the filtered water into my 5 gallon jug that sits on the cooler i refuse to spend 12 for 5 gallons of spring water i have no idea if it really is spring water i let my water sit open for 24 hours or more prior to filtering so the chlorine can vaporize and leave the water this allows the filters to last longer i have a water tester and my water tested with as many or more particles after using the filter it does get rid of the chlorine and they put a lot of chlorine in our water rural water system tried the cheaper nonbrita filters and they just arent as good unfortunately these new brita filters also do not require a 15 minute soak in water you instead just run cold water over the water filter now for 15 seconds and it is ready to go also there are so far a lot less black flecks in the top of the brita canister and the water tastes great overall to save a 1502 ish dollars the offbrand filters are just not worth it my guess is they do not contain as much activated charcoal i base this on my vast knowledge of water filter technology and science background that comes with being a communications major so basically nothing but the filter is great i do not buy bottled water i drink tap watersometimes funny tasting tap waterhold yer nose sulfur water that im told is good for me um but two years ago i was gifted with a brita pitcher it really makes a difference i soon needed replacement filters because i followed manufacturers instructions dont follow manufactures instructions ive found that i can use brita filters for many months and the water quality is crystal clear and without any unpleasant taste i only replace filters when the filter gets clogged up i started using the brita water pitcher over 5 years ago i always complained about how hard it was to remove the filter from the pitcher until now thank jesus for rd now they made so its very easy to get out and you do not have to soak it in a glass of water anymore these filter works great and you can really tell the difference when drinking water no chlorine taste and no charcoal flakes floating around in the water good price great product i only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars are meant for angels and gods works like it should water tastes great filtered with this a great price for all three good price for perfectly in the brita slim 5 cup pitcher filter leaks and a large portion of the water does not get filtered through my brita 10 cup grand water pitcher i purchased this filter so as to remove the unpleasant taste of tap water this filter only diminishes the taste as much of the water still gets through unfiltered as this does not accurately fit my pitcher yeah this is a brita review because why because these little boxes of charcoal make my disgusting dirty hot tub smelling municipal chlorine and flouride bath straight from the sewer tap water taste like im drinking straight form the freshest mountain stream these things work wonders works well it did come loose in the pitcher once and carbon dust came out and settled at the bottom after repositioning the filter and cleaning the bottom of the pitcher there was no more carbon dust i love these they are more people expensive at the store so better to by then on amazon i did not give them a 5 star because i cant tell what is actually filtered out only a lab could been buying these replacement filters for years great price with this bulk purchase really makes my water taste delightful also use filtered water in coffee maker and iron switched to pur because these filters went bad so quickly now the pur filters take forever to filter but still better than brita in my opinion fits better  water taste exactly like that comes out of the rap which is awful shameive been a happy customer for many years i got these and ended up splitting them with a friend great option instead of getting them from the store so much cheaper brita filters are good in general but do not filter deposits i sometimes see small particles of debris or sand dont have to soak it like the old ones no more black specks in the fill tank i like the improvements we live our brita pitcher the 3 pack was a good deal well be stocked for a few months now these newer style of filter general release less carbon black sediment in the water was messed up in the box wouldnt recomment and it doesnt filter out lead it claims to remove the heavy metals except i do not see lead on their list great  keep the pitcher filled to fill my keurig coffee pot very pleased with my purchase exactly what i wanted leaking black water for dayswater tastes weird no surprises good value not for retail packaging more convenient and cheaper than in stores my water is even cleaner now all the time good product but package not togged perfect you can taste the difference what can i say its a brita filter easy to use and work as expected as expected and at a great price these do a good job of filtering works great and taste great fast delivery good product works as it is supposed to great product  good price typical quality brita items makes the water taste great you need filter at beijing on time and as advertised needed by my brita machine great filter great price goes well with piture very good thanks as advertised a great buy great price good product works great very useful very good love it great good job perfect sometimes i wonder if the sensor on my brita filter means it really needs to be replaced or if its just a way for them to get me to buy more either way i replace these after a few months of use works wells well its a water filter not much to say cool stuff did not work on camping trip tried to filter my urinne to make clean water how do i apply for a refund great product be careful with stirring it when you are making carmelsweet corn the handle has a plastic gear on it and that can break if you twist it too hard or too fast i love making my own popcorn with olive oil and a little salt you dont need to buy their brand of popcorn they are great tasting but they are expensive do not buy another brand of ready to use popcorn oil and salt bags if they are cheap they will taste horrible just use regular popcorn one tablespoon popcorn to one tablespoon olive oil 45 tablespoons for 2 adults should be pretty close to perfect salt to preference great white elephant gift our family loves popcorn we were buying bags upon bags of popcorn to pop as our night time snack during family time there is no better snack on movie night in our house that is why when i saw the wabash valley farms whirleypop i couldnt wait to try it i read the mixed reviews and was cautiously optimistic the product arrived with a 55 oz wabash valley real theater popcorn allinclusive kit winning i was super excited for the bonus popcorn to try out our whirleypop for the first time we made our first batch of popcorn the night it arrived the directions included were super easy to follow and in 3 12 minutes we had perfectly popped buttery popcorn just like that in 3 12 minutes i was mom of the year the whirleypop was constructed really well all the pieces look like they will last a long time i had read a lot of comments about the gears breaking and i dont know if the company has improved that piece but mine appear to be extremely solid and well made i will update again after continued use i purchased the whirleypop in june 2015 through amazon a little over 6 months ago i would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it broke within 6 months and the wabash valley farms replacement cost despite its warranty is something you might want to consider when you purchase along with which version of the popper youd like i learned from the folks at wvf that the gears on the version amazon sells are plastic i hadnt known there were two versions of this popper available from wvf one with plastic gears and one with die cast metal gears wvf said that amazon opted to sell this version only but i could be upgraded to a replacement cover with the metal gears for an additional cost wabash valley farms has a 25 year warranty on its products but it cost me an additional 16 to upgrade to the metalgeared cover i thought i should warn other potential customers that given the real cost of a replacement that would last they might want to purchase the version with the metal gears in the first place \\xc2\\xa0the whirley pop is the best thing since sliced bread ever since i was a little girl i have loved homemade popcorn my grandmother would make it for us whenever we spent the night theater and microwave popcorn cannot hold a candle to grandmas popcorn a friend recently gave us a whirley pop popcorn popper oh my goodness this thing is the bomb tonight i made my second batch and it was as perfect as the first one was not one single unpopped kernal i seasoned the pot per the enclosed instructions before first use for both batches i used 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and one half cup orville redenbockers original gourmet popping corn both batches turned out perfectly i attached video to demonstrate how easy it is to use and the amount of popcorn in a single batch i had recently tried kettle korn and fell in love with the salty and sweet taste i tried to recreate it at home but just burnt my pots twice i looked up some recipes and came across a clip of martha stewart making some with the whirleypop after watching the video i placed an order for it when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it came with a bag of popcorn with butter i tried to make the kettle corn again and this time it was a success i have also made regular butter popcorn successfully if you do kettle corn add the sugar and salt a minute after you put all the corn kernels in they will be a whitish color thats the best time to add it in this popcorn popper is simple but works so well i received it as a gift and i wont make popcorn with anything else i use 12 cup of pop secret popcorn and a little bit of corn oil and i get 10 cups of perfectly popped popcorn every time i just made some and had just one unpopped kernel the only downside is that you have to hand wash lidhandle but i feel like thats a small price to pay love ithighly recommend what keeps me from loving it is the material used it feels like thin cheap metal that will damage pretty quickly ie burn marks that wont clean up as well as a pain to clean on the inside waiting to see what happens 5 uses in but so far so good just wish the metal was a little more sturdy or thickfirm i bought this product because i knew it would be far healthier than microwave popcorn it scratched the hell out of my stovetop with one use i never moved the pan just twirled the bottom of the pan appeared to not be flat it wobbled all over the burner dont buy this product if you value you stove i bought this as a surprise for my popcorn loving wife her words one of the be presents ever she is beyond pleased with the quality of the popping and taste of the popcorn it works just the way it is described and eliminates clean up too if you like popcorn you will love the whirleypop i bought this for my partner who had burnt up my big soup pot making popcorn he bought me a new pot for christmas  this popcorn maker is awesome for folks who just dont like the taste of air popped the handle is connected to a wire i believe hes used the thing every day since christmas all i can say cant go wrong with a whirley popwe had our old whirley pop for several years and had to get anouther oneif u want good popped popcorn the whirley pop is the way to go better then the electric popcorn poppersif u buy you wont be disappointed slight pain to clean not its fault really i love popcorn i use jiffy pop kernels or orville reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn cabot cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal its like crack you cant stop eating it',\n",
       " 'AmazonForClass3.csv': ' slight pain to clean not its fault really i love popcorn i use jiffy pop kernels or orville reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn cabot cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal its like crack you cant stop eating it works beautifully saves money compared to microwave popcorn when you use this to pop corn you get a truly healthful snack low in calories no artificial color flavor or preservatives i had forgotten how good freshly popped popcorn is love it easy to use easy to clean i was a bit worried that my lack of hand strength would make it hard to crank but not an issue in the least leaves very few unpops much healthier than microwave and just as fast i love this popcorn maker we have given up making instant popcorn and only do on the stove popcorn it doesnt take that much longer and it tastes so much better i definitely recommend this product have been using one of these for several years now great productworks well pops complete and easy clean up just wipe down also bought one for my parents and brothers places for when we visit user friendly had to discontinue using my previous pop corn popper because of sustaining first degree burns all over my palms happy that this ones ergonomic layout wont allow such to happen again way easier than holding a lid down while shaking the pot i havent had a burnt kernel yet seems well made with metal gears do yourself a favor and get a whirleypop stop eating microwave popcorn i bought two of these last summer and both broken in less than 6 months the plastic gears broke on both of them after being used 12 times a week for less than 6 months this is hands down the best and only way to make popcorn i now have popcorn at least three times a week for dinner thanks to this fabulous thing this is my second whirleypop the first one lasted over 15 years it makes great tasting popcorn the handle makes it safe for kids to help if you like popcorn you need this product we make ours with organic coconut oil and himalayan salt its easy to clean too i love this thing great tasting popcorn and you can make it healthier than the popcorn you buy at the store love follow the directions and the device does what it is supposed to do pop corn takes about five 5 minutes less than half the price of chefs version and just as good love it perfect gift we love our so much we gave this as a gift to my sisterinlaws family this year this makes making popcorn so much easier and it pops just about every kernel this thing really works popping time about the same as in the microwave excellent never burns  makes perfect coffee roasted to perfection easy to use easy to clean would like more if dishwasher safe like the whirley pop but the material itself is rather thin love this product makes making popcorn a cinch does not have weight and is not sturdy at all makes great stove top popcorn and doesnt burn perfect fluffy popcorn every time makes the best popcorn ever best way to have popcorn best popcorn maker ever daughter loved it i love it used it a lot when 1st got it but not so much any more seems like its about 6 degrees off at temperatures below 100 but dead on otherwise i bought it to use brewing beer so i needed something a bit more accurate for controlling fermentation tempature however ive started using it as a standard kitchen thermometer and it works great there i would buy it again certainly for the price if i needed a kitchen thermometer or bbq thermometer but for a super accurate low temp thermometer look elsewhere also i tested it for freezer monitoring and it will not read below 35 degree fahrenheit i give it 4 stars since it does work well but not at the range i we hoping for i used this thermometer on a beautiful cut of brisket in the smoker it was taking longer than it should have to reach temperature for the proper smoking time i used the old fashioned analog thermometer to find out i had over cooked it by 15 degrees i was left with a delicious shoe you dont need two but this thing works so well you should buy two anyway it has been rained on twice and still works great very reliable and accurate at a good value easy to use simple unit works great love alarm as advertised worked very well the one time i used it but no longer works after washing the probe in the dishwasher i had one of these before that died after years of use and frequent washing in the dish washer solid roaster at a low price will cook at 15 lb turkey just because of the patterned surface on the bottom i wouldnt use this for any other kind of cooking since it could be harder to clean therefore it is less versatile than heaviergauge products would be also with a 15 lb bird there is not a lot of space for vegetables underneath like others have said this arrived damaged it was badly dented and the metal was flaking off i actually got a sliver when i ran my hand over it this is a poor quality product i used it for my very first homecooked thanksgiving turkey and it was a huge success i deeply recommend this product was better than i expected and a great buy just like my moms when i was younger works great lid is warped quality not good do not recommend perfect size for a single person good pan for roasting great roasting pan was a gift the new first response tests are awful please go back to the old ones last month i got 4 positive tests on the new ones and i wasnt pregnant it was very sad since i have been ttc im pretty sure im pregannt  today is my expected period my last period was december 2 and i injtially took a test on dec 21 and was definitely a negative i didnt have a problem using these and they were clear to read i had a good experience with these and would recommend them in my case i tested for a situation that was pretty much impossible to get my pregnant but i wanted to make sure due to a scheduled surgery and i was being paranoid price is good but these tests really werent i got lines on two of them they werent as clear as a positive would be but i can definitely see how they would be misinterpreted as being positive especially when upon taking the thing apart the second line had pink on the edges so it doesnt look like just an indent or an evap it looked like a positive i almost cancelled surgery over it but thankfully went through and a previous blood test confirmed i wasnt pregnant which i couldnt be anyway presurgery nerves did something to my mind but i bet you could dip these things into plain water and get that line and the indent line being visible even when you dont take it apart can make the test pretty confusing in short i wouldnt recommend these at all the windows for me werent stark white and the viewing window was hard to see since it catches a lot of glare i will say that i doubt a strong pink line would be an evap line mine was very faint it gets a 5 star because it came back neg work fine gave me my results takes quiiiiite awhile for the hour glass to load up my results but it gets the job done  bety good product and very dast delivery as advertised and swift delivery early sensitivity my family was ready to move from plastic storage to glass and i did my research tried the rubbermaid version and ordered the pyrex the description says each has its own sealtight blue plastic lid lets be clear while the lids do sit firmly on the bowl they are not leak proof in fact if the bowl is turned sideways liquid will pour out from under the lip of the lid time will tell how durable this set is for the time being im disappointed in the quality of the seal i works really well in storage my food i dont have so much time so i usually make a lot of food on sunday and use this one to storage my food on refrigerator these food storage also work well on microwave just be careful dont immediately make changes in temperature i usually get it out of my refrigerator for about 15 minutes before i put it into microwave to reheat my food is contained in it its pyrex thick glass matching lids my only concern is how easily the lid broke in shipment the 7x11 lid was under the glass dish it matched with it broke at seam hopefully they start packing these better they packed glass well but forgot about lids probably assuming theyd be fine otherwise seem okay currently cooking with the dish we shall see if it was more than just lid issue i typically purchase the standard plastic containers but tired of the stains from spaghetti sauce and other foods i love these containers thick and sturdy glass in various sizes i originally wanted the red lids however the blue is really nice delivery was quick and the packaging was great lots of protection against breakage these are nice sturdy storage pieces they are however much much smaller than i had originally anticipated i wouldnt have ordered if i had realized how small they actually are they are pyrex though so they are of great quality they are made of thick glass and have lids that fit well giving them a nice and secure closure i love this set and use it all the time so much better than the plastic ones and come out nicely clean in dishwasheralthough do not put the lids in too they are nicely sized with no too tiny ones you never use highly recommend this set for its quality and usefulness and nothing beats pyrex love these containers they seal very well and havent had a problem with any leaking liquids or the lids falling off while storing food in my backpack on the way to work they are pretty solid and feel heavy which makes them feel expensive i got them on a deal and it was very worth the money i paid this a great set for cold storage and reheating we replaced plastic containers that were staining and did not fare well on the microwave these glass containers store easy by nesting in themselves and the lids fit well and seal tight i recommend this product very versatile and great for everything from storage to good prep lids hold securely and air tight they also stack pretty well and dont slip when on top of one another cause the lids are quite grippy with proper care they will last forever as will most pyrex products its so convenient to be able to store food in the same dish it was cooked in i love this set these are solid glass baking dishes just as we have come to expect from pyrex the covers fit snugly and stack easily if needed nice variety of sizes for different needs very nice storage set that keeps food fresh for a long time pyrex is a brand i trust as ive dropped and clanged these dishes and they have not chipped or broke i recieved the pyrex 10 piece storage set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review very nice high quality i use these to store all my tomato based sauces as well as anything else that is acidic they wash up great there are no stains on these because of that they look so much nicer than my old plastic containers ever did after one use great and practical overall only downside is that while pyrex suggests that you use place the lid on top of the container when microwaving ive had one instance of the lid basically imploding  now the lid is deformed and doesnt work the way it sound variety of sizes use thse for everything didnt even bother buying bowls to go along with our plates as these were just fine its not as great as the old durable pyrex but have not have broken one and thyve been all over the range of sizes is exactly what i needed they store compactly nestled inside each other i put the lid on the bottom to separate the layers of glass microwave and dishwasher safe top rack for lids nice set at the price i love pyrex products and i needed a set like this with the price it was a great deal covers are boring blue color but i dont really mind that smaller than expected but good tight seal oven safe id buy a ton more and give 5 stars if there was a more stackable solution still not easy to organize you cant really go wrong with pyrex all but the largest rectangle one fit in my lunch bag comfortably otherwise great for food storage bought them for my girlfriend she loves them they are super stout and are all one color which my ocd girlfriend appreciates this is a very nice set of bowls from pyrex they are just the right size for leftovers and the dot pattern is cheerful too these are great leftover containers i bought 2 packages and replaced a lot of plastic containers these are a great buy pyrex is great quality but these are smaller than expected but the price is great for the brand i love pyrex and have never been disappointed in one of their products great set of containers the kids dont go on as easy as normal pyrex all sizes as quite small for the price who doesnt love pyrex and how amazing it is great purchase for the price pyrex is the best however i was a bit surprised by the sizes pretty small very handy containers for leftovers cant go wrong with polka dots lid melted in the microwave first time being cooked pass on these best purchase i made when i threw away all my plastic containers good price and nice product love glassware versus the plastic bad quality lids can not withstand the heat in the microwave i always buy pyrex for the quality and a good price arrived on time and assembled easily great product  works as advertised great price present for my mother great they come in very handy very useful and great quality good quality i love them not as big as i expected excellent pyrex product great price for this set just what i needed whats not to like love the bowls love my pyrex no complaints great storage great quality very sturdy love them love these excellent i love these i like them the ist one arrived  no lights workrd so sent it right back they sent a replacement and everything works but the clock light never lights up i wanted to send it back toobut my husband was sick of having no coffee so we kept it everything is great with it but i just get mad everytime i look at it  cant read the time sorry absolutely love love this programmable coffee maker makes great coffee  is well made highly recommend have owned this for years and it still works great love it simply put the best coffee maker on the market best coffee maker we have ever owned as expected arrived on time excellent works great so far ive used it to cut up cucumbers carrots lettuce tomatoes potatoes and a few other things with both thick and thin blades i havent had a problem with smushing tomatoes its pretty easy to set up and use right out the box ive had a few issues with uneven cuts but im pretty sure that its my fault since i hadnt used one before there are a couple reasons i took off one star theres no easy way to store this without keeping it in the box and even then its a pain to get everything to fit back in nicely one of the pictures shows a nice way to situate everything to store but i havent gotten that to work yet it would be nice if it had a bigger stand or something slicing over a cutting mat can be kind of a pain there is some waste with the way you use the slice and holder i got a safety glove which i would recommend anyway and its reduced the waste a lot since i can hold that last piece and slide it myself overall its a good purchase and would recommend i have one and use it a lot and got one for my daughter for christmas she is learning to use it as its very sharp and can get cut pretty bad if not careful it comes with a guard that really must be used  very nice very sharp ive had this mandoline slicer for about 7 years i use it all the time and it still cuts as good as the day i bought it this thing is great the cost is unbeliveable and it works great thin slices and i feel safe using it i use it for everything its easy to clean and cuts almost all veggies in less than a minute excellent product great product this was a present for my daughter i havent heard anything back about it so i dont know how she likes it this pillow while not the greatest in aesthetic quality is great i agonized over buying a costly pillow i wasnt sure would work but im so glad i did it does come with a slipcover sure its a bit flimsy but ive already removed it to wash it and it was fine for people who turn a lot i can see that this might be cumbersome to start but ive adjusted easily to simply pulling my knees up and then rotating and putting them down again for an easy middle of the night turn my favorite maternity purchase for sure and its already been useful when i babysat my niece 7mos as a bumper on my bed to prevent rolling so im excite to keep using it after maternity as well finally some relief i bought this pillow while laying in my hospital bed for 11 days for a compression fracture of the spine due to a fall i know that it seems that mostly pregnant women are using this pillow and i can certainly understand why but it is also a wonderful alternative for people with pain i also have fibromyalgia bursitis of the shoulder and osteoarthritis of the hips back and knees believe me i know what pain is and now due to this awesome pillow i finally have some relief i may just never want to get out of bed again being pregnant was great until the end of the second trimester i didnt even gain that much weight but the sheer size of my belly was just uncomfortable no matter what  until i laid on my left side in bed with my snoogle my boyfriend quickly grew jealous of my pillow when i started to really rely heavily pun intended on it for cuddling at night instead of him it held up to my weight and sweat 7 months pregnant in florida in the summer and i even took it with me to disney world my mom has sciatica and she absolutely loves this pillow granted she loves all pillows but this one is unlike her regular body is better because its nice and firm and actually gives her support it comes with a sheet that gives you different ideas on how to use the pillow its very versatile with many uses i have even seen her walking around her house with it wrapped around her body like a snake when she got it her dog got jealous of it so i think that says something my wife was really having a hard time getting comfortable at night during her pregnancy so after a ton of research we settled on this we didnt want something super massive to the point that i would essentially be sleeping on the floor this pillow is the perfect companion for our bed its not to big but yet it hits all the comfort points if you share a bed with someone and your bed is smaller than a queen this probably isnt the right pillow for you purchased for my fiance which was great during the first month but product did not even last 7 months by the time she was 8 months into her pregnancy the pillow was no longer fluffy and did not retain its shape in addition the pillow cover was not comfortable at all had to tailor pillow covers with other fabric because the covers offered by leachco were all rough which made the skin itch the material is nice and is soft my sister purchased this item when she was within her first trimester and she did not use it much during maybe the middle of her second trimester is when she began to use the snoogle she uses it at night when she goes to bed the only down side to the snoogle that my sister and brotherinlaw can think is the pillow cover once you take it off it can be difficult to put back on because the opening to the pillow cover is only at one end this means that you have to put the entire pillow cover back on from one end and pull the pillow through the cover all the way to the other end of the pillow we thought it would be better if maybe a zipper was involved just because it would be easier to put the cover back on the pillow overall it is still a very nice pillow my wife was not very impressed it doesnt really support your back at best it might just keep your back warm it is nice to have the pillow between the legs but you dont need a total body pillow for that she didnt like that she couldnt use her regular pillow for her head when using this it mostly just sits by the side of our bed this was my first pregnancy pillow purchase and i returned it for the jersey version this version has a weird cover that is super scratchy and uncomfortable the neck part was also diggy i dont have any problems with the jersey version though so if you are looking pay the couple extra dollars and get the jersey chic version of this pillow i didnt want to cave and get a pregnancy pillow because of the price but i am glad i did this pillow does not completely take away back pain while sleeping but it does make sleeping a whole lot more comfortable i use it every night and even during the day if i lay down on the floor highly recommend loved this product when i bought it last year when i had to buy a new one i was excited truly was an amazing product however im not sure if something has changed with the stuffing or what but this pillow now gives me terrible headaches i cant use it at all what a huge waste of  this pillow is completely worth it i started sleeping with my snoogle when i was about 56 months pregnant and found that i couldnt sleep without it even my husband has commented on how comfortable it is definitely worth it too hard and too big i would love it if it will allow me to use my own pillow but its too big and i have to use it as my pillow but it is too hard and high for me makes my neck stiff in the morning i really hate it i thought i would love this but it takes up so much space it is like having a third person in bed with us i also think i may be a little tall for it i am 6 feet tall so it is hard to get comfortable around 18 weeks i was started becoming uncomfortable while sleeping and this helped tremendously i suggest buying the jersey cover for it the original cover is a bit rough feeling on your skin i love this pillow i have used it for two pregnancies and one major surgery its a life saver especially with last trimester does need the jersey cover to make it really comfortable though very comfortable and durable i could sleep with it by hugging the pillow as well as using it as back support if i want to roll over all i can say is i wish i had bought this item earlier really helped with my sleep issues great product at a great price thanks absolutely love it im only in my first trimester and it really helps support my back without it i cant sleep on my side this pillow is awesome super comfy and works well i love it so much and so does my husband who likes to steal it from me bought for my pregnant daughter loved it so much she bought another comfortable and supportivesleeps like a rock great if you dont move around much in bed but for me i needed something i could roll with and this was way to large i bought it to help with back pain while pregnant and ended up loving it more for nursing in bed absolutely worth it i recommend this pillow to everyone pregnant or not pregnant im finally getting a good night sleep great buy my wife loves this pillow and unfortunately will no longer snuggle with me it is a must for any pregnant woman good pillow a shame it is made in that shape and you cant make it straight since it gets a little uncomfy if pregnant or having back issues this pillow is ideal it is the only pillow i need during my pregnancy almost like having a boyfriend says my wife i think she was joking anyway shes happy my wife didnt like this product at first glance but as soon as she slept with it she was in love i love my snoogle this quickly turned into a pregnancy essential for me cant sleep without it cant leave without this pillow either side of it is super comfy during sleep worth every penny thing is super comfy got it for my pregnant wife and ended up using it for my sciatica as well if you want your wife to stop cuddling you at night when its time to sleep buy this for her i bought it for my sister who is pregnant she used it the first night and said she loved it i had so much trouble sleeping and this has completely eliminated my discomfort this was my best friend when i was pregnant it helped me sleep more comfortable the best pregnancy pillow out there its not too fat so its easy to cuddle with bought this for my daughter she loves it would be nice to have an extra cover had a lot to chose from but in the end im glad i chose this one i love it bought this for my daughter and she is loving it fast shipping my wife loved this pillow through her 2nd and 3rd trimesters been using it 5 months and cant imagine sleeping without it my lady loves this pillow happy wife happy life lol best gift for expecting moms easy to wash i can not without this pillow when i sleep so uncomfortable  and too big somebody do not like it very comfortable love it returned thanks great difficult to put on impossible for me needs larger opening possibly with zipper or velcreo this is a fun product i did confuse joseph with one of the wisemen for a short period of time look for the one not holding anything the noise is not to loud and it doesnt last long which is helpful any of the pieces fit on top which makes it even more fun for the children it is very simple to assemble also i got this for my niece and she loved it played with it for quite some time before getting distracted she came back to this toy a lot through out the day this is a great way for children to have a nativity that they can play with while parents have the untouchable kind this was so perfect with a 2 year old and a 4 year old i needed something that they would be allowed to play with i remember growing up and always wanting to play with the set my parents had we were never allowed to touch our s and it was torture lol this one is so cute and fun for the kids the book that you can buy in addition to this is also great my kids had a blast reenacting the book with the characters this was brand new and priced better than most sites i looked at i think my daughter was more thrilled than my grandson but he will always have his own nativity scene to handle and learn to appreciate what it represents my grandchildren loved it they had been picking up the pieces of my nativity scene so i got them one of their own they loved picking up the pieces and moving them around without the worry of dropping or breaking it i gave as a gift to my sister with a little girl a great product to have with little kids they have a nativity set to play with and you have ones that dont get broken my 2 year old loves her lp nativity scene she has learned the christmas story well after playing with this throughout the christmas season love it great quality the kids love playing with it so much they were sad to see all the characters get packed up in the christmas box until next year good little set but comes with a lot of pieces which inevitably end up all over our living room floor price for the value is good super cute put out as a xmas decor for the holiday but my grandson loves it so much im keeping it out we loved sharing the christmas story with our toddler grandchildren thank you loved the nativity set and it was delivered when promised its so cute and my granddaughters love it great quality my son loved this our grand daughter just loved it wonderful gift for every child nothing wrong with the replacement but after 3 years of using the blades it came with my shaving experience did not change whatsoever by getting new blades the only difference is that i feel like the shaver is working a little harder or theres a little less noise but no shaving or cutting improvement the heads themselves or ok the shipping time was ok the price however went up 5 in the past year thats 25 in one year that is too much since i bought the razor i have little choice bugs me though first time buying for bazinga treading a amazon talk about your quick response and shipping and im not a priority customer price was very reasonable and i am a 5 star happy customer super product the razor is over five years old and still works well the phillips catalog is confusing hard to pick the correct replacement heads this is the second time ive purchased this replacement head buy one every year or so and your shaver will be like new'}"
