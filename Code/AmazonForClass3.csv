I use jiffy pop kernels or Orville Reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn. Cabot Cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal. Its like crack, you can\t stop eating it.^5.00
B00004SU35^R2BOLV9OQB85S6^Absolutely love it!^A26E78HV5JUEQB^2016-01-14^ Works beautifully! Saves money compared to microwave popcorn. When you use this to pop corn you get a truly healthful snack. Low in calories; no artificial color, flavor or preservatives. I had forgotten how good freshly popped popcorn is.^5.00
B00004SU35^R3Y5LT0ST62UH^Great product. Wish I had bought sooner^A1MBDNQCRIEGZI^2015-12-15^ LOVE IT!!! Easy to use, easy to clean. I was a bit worried that my lack of hand strength would make it hard to crank, but not an issue in the least. Leaves very few unpops, much healthier than microwave and just as fast.^5.00

B00004SU35^R2FJUQQGLBK71J^Great popper! Have used for years.^A2K3ANVVVTCB9K^2016-01-18^ Have been using one of these for several years now. Great product..works well, pops complete, and easy clean up, just wipe down. Also bought one for my parent\s and brother\s places for when we visit.^5.00

B00004XSC5^R1FQ820Q6JRD94^Works well as a kitchen thermometer^A8HSW4ETJZIPJ^2016-01-21^ Seems like it\s about 6 degrees off at temperatures below 100, but dead on otherwise. I bought it to use brewing beer, so I needed something a bit more accurate for controlling fermentation tempature. However, I\ve started using it as a standard kitchen thermometer and it works great there! I would buy it again, certainly for the price, if I needed a kitchen thermometer or BBQ thermometer, but for a super accurate low temp thermometer, look elsewhere. Also, I tested it for freezer monitoring, and it will not read below 35 degree Fahrenheit. I give it 4 stars since it does work well, but not at the range I we hoping for.^4.00
B00004XSC5^R39LWBBFZIOA5E^Killed a beautiful brisket.^A2JX0MMUKK5N3T^2016-01-15^ I used this thermometer on a beautiful cut of brisket in the smoker.

B000050AVC^R3L41G9O1M3O45^Good value, not especially versatile^A1W7W4KSQ4TSSV^2016-01-22^ Solid roaster at a low price, will cook at 15 lb turkey (just). Because of the patterned surface on the bottom I wouldn\t use this for any other kind of cooking since it could be harder to clean. Therefore it is less versatile than heavier-gauge products would be. Also, with a 15 lb bird there is not a lot of space for vegetables underneath.^4.00
B000050AVC^R1LGI4ZSMMZM60^Like others have said^A39I68EHLQ4Y8V^2016-01-12^ Like others have said, this arrived damaged. It was badly dented and the metal was flaking off. I actually got a sliver when I ran my hand over it. This is a poor quality product.^1.00

B000052XHI^R3OO0RSR58OBYH^Are these considered faint lines ???^A3ORQAJWK3GO9U^2015-12-27^ I\m pretty sure I\m pregannt ! Today is my expected period, my last period was December 2 and I injtially took a test on dec 21 and was definitely a negative^5.00

B000052XHI^RYOSXUWEUV6AB^Indent and evap lines look like positives...^A28DTEW2FE3IKK^2016-01-13^ In my case, I tested for a situation that was pretty much impossible to get my pregnant. But I wanted to make sure due to a scheduled surgery, and I was being paranoid. Price is good, but these tests really weren\t. I got lines on two of them. They weren\t as clear as a positive would be, but I can definitely see how they would be misinterpreted as being positive, especially when, upon taking the thing apart, the second line had pink on the edges. So it doesn\t look like just an indent or an evap. It looked like a positive. I almost cancelled surgery over it, but thankfully went through and a previous blood test confirmed I wasn\t pregnant. Which I couldn\t be anyway. Pre-surgery nerves did something to my mind. But I bet you could dip these things into plain water and get that line, and the indent line being visible even when you don\t take it apart can make the test pretty confusing. In short I wouldn\t recommend these at all. The windows for me weren\t stark white and the viewing window was hard to see since it catches a lot of glare. I will say that I doubt a strong pink line would be an evap line, mine was very faint.^3.00

B00005B8K5^R91HIRJ3R37QI^I\m disappointed in the quality of the seal^AJ4C65QT7KQFZ^2016-01-13^ My family was ready to move from plastic storage to glass and I did my research, tried the Rubbermaid version, and ordered the Pyrex. The description says, Each has its own seal-tight, blue plastic lid. Let\s be clear... while the lids do sit firmly on the bowl, they ARE NOT leak proof. In fact, if the bowl is turned sideways, liquid will POUR out from under the lip of the lid. Time will tell how durable this set is, for the time being, I\m disappointed in the quality of the seal.^3.00

I don\t have so much time so I usually make a lot of food on Sunday and use this one to storage my food on refrigerator. These food storage also work well on microwave. Just be careful don\t immediately make changes in temperature. I usually get it out of my refrigerator for about 15 minutes before I put it into microwave to reheat my food is contained in it.^4.00
B00005B8K5^R3FUE7AJYKFWPT^Broken lid, otberwise seem okay^A11JDYOBJ01RLI^2016-01-10^ It\s pyrex... Thick glass, matching lids. My only concern is how easily the lid broke in shipment. The 7x11 lid was under the glass dish it matched with. It broke at seam. Hopefully they start packing these better, they packed glass well but forgot about lids probably assuming they\d be fine. Otherwise, seem okay. Currently cooking with the dish... We shall see if it was more than just lid issue.^4.00
B00005B8K5^R50QDWQ9SD79L^Love them^A1AU2O64EYEXBN^2016-01-14^ I typically purchase the standard plastic containers, but tired of the stains from spaghetti sauce and other foods. I love these containers. Thick and sturdy glass in various sizes. I originally wanted the red lids; however, the blue is really nice. Delivery was quick and the packaging was great. Lots of protection against breakage.^5.00
B00005B8K5^R29D70GV7ZT4MH^These are nice, sturdy storage pieces^A31UMR1V1MFPM0^2016-01-16^ These are nice, sturdy storage pieces. They are, however, much much smaller than I had originally anticipated. I wouldn\t have ordered if I had realized how small they actually are. They are Pyrex though, so they are of great quality. They are made of thick glass and have lids that fit well, giving them a nice and secure closure.^3.00

B00005B8K5^R1KWXQJKSAY2WN^My Favorite containers to Take to Work^A3CQOC4W0FE04O^2016-01-17^ Love these containers. They seal very well and haven\t had a problem with any leaking liquids or the lids falling off while storing food in my backpack on the way to work. They are pretty solid and feel heavy which makes them feel expensive. I got them on a deal and it was VERY worth the money I paid.^5.00

B00005B8K5^R18VK4D3YRVB5J^Great alternative to plastic^A3EZCD4T7TI2CK^2015-12-27^ Very nice, high quality. I use these to store all my tomato based sauces, as well as anything else that is acidic.

B0000632QE^R3HRQ6FE2MKUL1^Pretty Good^A3N7PVWP6BJAWU^2016-01-21^ Works great so far. I\ve used it to cut up cucumbers, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, and a few other things with both thick and thin blades. I haven\t had a problem with smushing tomatoes. It\s pretty easy to set up and use right out the box. I\ve had a few issues with uneven cuts but I\m pretty sure that it\s my fault since I hadn\t used one before. There are a couple reasons I took off one star. There\s no easy way to store this without keeping it in the box and even then it\s a pain to get everything to fit back in nicely. One of the pictures shows a nice way to situate everything to store but I haven\t gotten that to work yet. It would be nice if it had a bigger stand or something, slicing over a cutting mat can be kind of a pain. There is some waste with the way you use the slice and holder. I got a safety glove (which I would recommend anyway) and it\s reduced the waste a lot since I can hold that last piece and slide it myself. Overall, it\s a good purchase and would recommend.^4.00
B0000632QE^R1EYZRCKYB7IAE^She is learning to use it as its very sharp and can get cut pretty bad if not careful^A3V0KXGJMNXNP^2016-01-19^ I have one and use it a lot and got one for my daughter for Christmas. She is learning to use it as its very sharp and can get cut pretty bad if not careful. It comes with a guard that really must be used .^5.00
B0000632QE^R1Z8W5XRS0QYIL^Excellent Quality^A3JB1FLPVJ1TXU^2016-01-18^ Very Nice, Very Sharp. I\ve had this Mandoline slicer for about 7 years. I use it all the time, and it still cuts as good as the day I bought it^5.00

B0000635WI^R3NWHUBCB6VYIU^Good for maternity and beyond^A3VGSLUWO0EGTC^2016-01-12^ This pillow, while not the greatest in aesthetic quality, is great! I agonized over buying a costly pillow I wasn\t sure would work but I\m so glad I did. It DOES come with a slipcover, sure it\s a bit flimsy but I\ve already removed it to wash it and it was fine. For people who turn a lot I can see that this might be cumbersome to start but I\ve adjusted easily to simply pulling my knees up and then rotating and putting them down again for an easy middle of the night turn. My favorite maternity purchase for sure and it\s already been useful when I babysat my niece (7mos) as a bumper on my bed to prevent rolling so I\m excite to keep using it after maternity as well.^4.00
B0000635WI^R3R7RNRLVEJHY^love, love, love it!^A1VW52SAULTW26^2016-01-15^ Finally some relief! I bought this pillow while laying in my hospital bed for 11 days for a compression fracture of the spine due to a fall. I know that it seems that mostly pregnant women are using this pillow, and I can certainly understand why, but, it is also a wonderful alternative for people with pain. I also have fibromyalgia, bursitis of the shoulder and osteoarthritis of the hips, back and knees. Believe me, I know what pain is and now, due to this awesome pillow, I finally have some relief. I may just never want to get out of bed again!^5.00
B0000635WI^R11RA6SZOINBLE^This pillow saved my life^A1KWUGO94M6DO0^2016-01-18^ Being pregnant was great. Until the end of the second trimester. I didn\t even gain that much weight but the sheer size of my belly was just uncomfortable no matter what - until I laid on my left side in bed with my snoogle. My boyfriend quickly grew jealous of my pillow when I started to really rely heavily (pun intended) on it for cuddling at night instead of him. It held up to my weight and sweat (7 months pregnant in Florida in the summer) and I even took it with me to Disney world.^5.00
B0000635WI^R2YRZ05HQPWD1G^Awesome^AGH60CK0BF2BA^2016-01-01^ My mom has sciatica and she absolutely loves this pillow. Granted she loves all pillows but this one is unlike her regular body is better because it\s nice and firm and actually gives her support. It comes with a sheet that gives you different ideas on how to use the pillow it\s very versatile with many uses. I have even seen her walking around her house with it wrapped around her body like a snake. When she got it her dog got jealous of it so I think that says something.^5.00
B0000635WI^R226IFZMZZ4MG9^Perfect Bed Companion^A3H1SQXSBQG1ON^2016-01-19^ My wife was really having a hard time getting comfortable at night during her pregnancy. So after a ton of research, we settled on this. We didn\t want something super massive, to the point that I would essentially be sleeping on the floor. This pillow is the perfect companion for our bed. It\s not to big, but yet, it hits all the comfort points. If you share a bed with someone and your bed is smaller than a queen, this probably isn\t the right pillow for you.^5.00
B0000635WI^RTD3ZUY9PC6TQ^Purchased for my fiance which was great during the first month but product did not even ...^A2UN537IJRK4L2^2016-01-16^ Purchased for my fiance which was great during the first month but product did not even last 7 months. By the time she was 8 months into her pregnancy, the pillow was no longer fluffy and did not retain its shape. In addition, the pillow cover was NOT comfortable at all. Had to tailor pillow covers with other fabric because the covers offered by Leachco were all rough, which made the skin itch.^2.00
B0000635WI^ROXMLQQS66ABF^Nice Body Pillow^A2QTYVG0VR7FE8^2016-01-08^ The material is nice and is soft. My sister purchased this item when she was within her first trimester and she did not use it much. During maybe the middle of her second trimester is when she began to use the snoogle. She uses it at night when she goes to bed. The only down side to the Snoogle that my sister and brother-in-law can think is the pillow cover. Once you take it off it can be difficult to put back on because the opening to the pillow cover is only at one end. This means that you have to put the entire pillow cover back on from one end and pull the pillow through the cover all the way to the other end of the pillow. We thought it would be better if maybe a zipper was involved just because it would be easier to put the cover back on the pillow. Overall, it is still a very nice pillow.^4.00
B0000635WI^RM2N2UT9TX43V^at best it might just keep your back warm^A2FN15XRKIFAYK^2016-01-20^ My wife was not very impressed. It doesn\t really support your back, at best it might just keep your back warm. It is nice to have the pillow between the legs, but you don\t need a total body pillow for that. She didn\t like that she couldn\t use her regular pillow for her head when using this. It mostly just sits by the side of our bed.^3.00
B0000635WI^RNGL8WMZAQDN2^Cover is too scratchy^ABT5BHIY1UJTP^2016-01-03^ This was my first pregnancy pillow purchase and I returned it for the jersey version. This version has a weird cover that is super scratchy and uncomfortable. The neck part was also diggy. I dont have any problems with the jersey version though so if you are looking pay the couple extra dollars and get the jersey chic version of this pillow!^2.00
B0000635WI^R18ZBKAOP1PXXH^but I am glad I did^AP2VNPPFBXFIQ^2016-01-20^ I didn\t want to cave and get a pregnancy pillow because of the price, but I am glad I did. This pillow does not completely take away back pain while sleeping, but it does make sleeping a WHOLE lot more comfortable! I use it every night and even during the day if I lay down on the floor. Highly recommend!^5.00

Truly was an amazing product. However I\m not sure if something has changed with the stuffing or what but this pillow now gives me terrible headaches. I can\t use it at all. What a huge waste of $!^1.00
B0000635WI^R252IZRW1F0SES^Great Pillow!^A13S02E6YTRNCQ^2015-12-17^ This pillow is completely worth it!

B0000635WI^R2KBM2B7HSBMLP^Too hard and too big^AL39C3A34L1I3^2016-01-11^ Too hard and too big. I would love it if it will allow me to use my own pillow, but it\s too big and I have to use it as my pillow, but it is too hard and high for me, makes my neck stiff in the morning. I really hate it!^1.00

I also think I may be a little tall for it (I am 6 feet tall) so it is hard to get comfortable.^4.00
B0000635WI^R25ZS6IKD44BSR^A pregnancy must have!^AE08YAA7EG932^2016-01-15^ Around 18 weeks I was started becoming uncomfortable while sleeping, and this helped tremendously! I suggest buying the jersey cover for it, the original cover is a bit rough feeling on your skin.^5.00

Look for the one not holding anything. The noise is not to loud, and it doesn\t last long which is helpful. Any of the pieces fit on top which makes it even more fun for the children. It is very simple to assemble also. I got this for my niece and she loved it. Played with it for quite some time before getting distracted. She came back to this toy a lot through out the day. This is a great way for children to have a nativity that they can play with while parents have the untouchable kind.^5.00
B000067R86^R11EKQIYSXYC2V^Fun for the kids!^AST4HSM1QCZDW^2016-01-21^ This was so perfect. With a 2 year old and a 4 year old, I needed something that they would be allowed to play with. I remember growing up and always wanting to play with the set my parents had. We were never allowed to touch our s and it was torture! LOL! This one is so cute and fun for the kids. The book that you can buy in addition to this is also great. My kids had a blast reenacting the book with the characters.^5.00
B000067R86^R1DD2H4YGH5NG3^This was brand new and priced better than most sites I looked at^A1Z230VB260JB5^2016-01-19^ This was brand new and priced better than most sites I looked at. I think my daughter was more thrilled than my grandson, but he will always have his own Nativity Scene to handle and learn to appreciate what it represents.^5.00

They had been picking up the pieces of my nativity scene, so I got them one of their own. They loved picking up the pieces and moving them around without the worry of dropping or breaking it!!^5.00

B000068PBT^RVTPEYJKRSN0U^No need to replace...^A1NDGH0TH39NAT^2016-01-21^ Nothing wrong with the replacement... but after 3 years of using the blades it came with, my shaving experience did not change whatsoever by getting new blades. The only difference is that I feel like the shaver is working a little harder, or there\s a little less noise, but no shaving or cutting improvement.^3.00
B000068PBT^RB6BMKXD7VMS6^OUCH! Cost went way up!^A1FGGN1V7DQAMD^2016-01-14^ The heads themselves or OK. The shipping time was OK. The price however, went up $5 in the past year. That\s 25%, in one year. That is too much. Since I bought the razor, I have little choice. Bugs me though.^3.00
B000068PBT^R2CW9IN6TBFU1Y^Price was very reasonable and I am a 5 star happy customer.^A369BBVU696YKC^2016-01-21^ first time buying for Bazinga Treading a Amazon. Talk about your quick response and shipping and I\m not a priority customer. Price was very reasonable and I am a 5 star happy customer.^5.00
B000068PBT^RRI6JM5H7H2BF^Super product. The razor is over five years old ...^A3FF0XBIN2IC4O^2016-01-22^ Super product. The razor is over five years old and still works well. The Phillips catalog is confusing. Hard to pick the correct replacement heads.^5.00
B000068PBT^R1D8H8KSDATM3E^and your shaver will be like new.^A10FHWBKU8GVLT^2016-01-22^ This is the second time I\ve purchased this replacement head. Buy one every year or so, and your shaver will be like new.^4.00
