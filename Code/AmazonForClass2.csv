B00004SPEU^RFG625MOZSZEO^Good Design but Fragile Cap is a deal breaker^A22FFXBR4U3S8X^2015-12-22^ The key to a good coffee or spice grinder is a non-oval non-elliptical interior that kicks the spice into the blades. Krups adds a flat side to the cap interior so it does this and grinds well but Krups makes the cap from a cheap brittle plastic that spontaneously cracks from normal use. I patched the first crack but others kept coming -- there are already five after three months of use -- and this means that cap will sooner rather than later break apart. (See photo) Amazon\s price was $19.99 but I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon that brought the price to $15.00.^3.00
B00004SPEU^R3GA7E9VRWJQI7^Great grinder for spices, but not coffee^A3DBYW1QSYZLOU^2015-12-22^ Pros: Cheap, powerful motor and blades Cons: Uneven grind, smallish capacity If you\re looking for a coffee grinder, I wouldn\t recommend a bladed one, especially if you care about using the right size grind for the right drink. Blade grinders are cheap, but a burr grinder ensures a uniform grind, which is important to get a consistent flavor and brew. This grinder, however, would be perfect for spices, and I would actually recommend using it only for that. Cleaning is relatively easy: just use a damp paper towel to wipe up the remains and a dry one to finish the job.^4.00
B00004SPEU^R20VKUAOPJFBJ0^I got this for my parents who love coffee. They didn\t really like this product and ...^A6WAAPPI7V2LC^2016-01-19^ I got this for my parents who love coffee. They didn\t really like this product and actually went back to their old coffee grinder.. Something about how the beans weren\t grinded up too well or something.. So I\m guessing this product isn\t really for coffee addicts.^2.00
B00004SPEU^R76KSYSMMCKUS^Does powder all your food items, but is impossible to clean without washing.^A3JJUPM8UOTRMN^2016-01-11^ This thing can grind! It has ground up everything I have placed in it with ease! Now the bad stuff. The unit is really really hard to clean. The only way to keep it clean is to wash it after every use. I use it to grind up foods I have dehydrated. It has powdered up sweet peppers, carrots, kale, beets, lime, ginger, and turbinado sugar. So after each use I had to clean it up. It was a big chore due to not having any napkins! I bought a brush to clean it but it isn\t the best thing and you will need to put some water in it to get the dust out from the bottom of the blade. The unit does seem to be waterproof but I am not trying to find out. It did shoot water out from the lid so I learned really fast to only place a small amount in there at a time as to allow the particles stuck under the blade to remove themselves. The unit itself is surprisingly heavy. After a few uses it stopped working but with a few shakes it would turn on. I believe it stopped working due to the lid not being down all the way. I want to process coffee beans at least once to see the end results but from my experience I don\t know how anyone could get anything but a fine grind. It seems to powder everything in seconds. In seconds you can see powder forming on the lid. I have no idea how I would get a coarse grind with the KRUPS. Maybe the result is different with coffee beans than with dehydrated food. I imagine I would have to pulse it for no longer than a second. This is exactly what I was looking for though in the end so I give it 5 stars.^5.00
B00004SPEU^R2LZ0WV7FBQ2O3^Krups F203 Coffee grinder^A39LH173CC2DAF^2016-01-16^ Replaced a really old grinder of similar type by Cusinart, This one works great and I like it since it has a larger capacity for beans so I can grind more at once. Of course the grind depends on how long you hold the button down. I like mine ground fine for an espresso machine. Some powder tends to cake under the blades. I have developed a habit of holding it up when I push the button and tilt it sideways back and forth during grinding to facilitate mixing. One would do well to count the seconds for the grind you like so to be more consistent over time. I believe it takes about 10 seconds to get to a fine enough grind. After done I put the gound coffee into a small can making a day or two\s worth at one time so it is always fresh. One needs to use their finger or another object to get the caked product out of the bottom but it is not a big deal. It is easy to clean with a paper towel around the inside tapping the remainder out. I found a small brush which I use to get grind out of the crevasses. Overall I find it is a great value and works well for small portions.^5.00
B00004SPEU^R2GVKQDOPNVQEG^The only spice mill you\ll ever need!^A3HZL2CCV3USSN^2016-01-02^ I buy and use whole spices from a health food store. It is fresher and cheaper than packaged spices on the grocery shelves. It allows me the flexibility to purchase exact amounts for a particular recipe without wasting the unused portions. Instead of buying individual spice mills I wanted one mill that could do all types of grinding, coarse or fine. I went to America\s Tedt Kitchen website to read their reviews. This product was 5 star rated. Knowing I could trust their experience and review I purchased the mill. It livesup to its claim! It has a removable cup for easy pouring and cleaning. It\s the only spice mill I need. And yes, it does awesome with coffee beans, nuts, etc. I highly recommend this product! It is easy, quick, and produces an even grind.^5.00
B00004SPEU^R2J45BAF4K64MT^Highly rated â?¦ TOO MESSY!^A12PXIZ6MHO0HP^2016-01-15^ On a mission to replace my last coffee bean grinder I spent considerable time reading reviews of the top-rated ones. I finally decided on this one. Big mistake. The KRUPS F203 does, indeed, grind coffee beans. But trying to transfer the grounds to oneâ??s coffee maker results in a huge mess. (I wouldnâ??t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices. But itâ??s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans.) Summary: I quit grinding coffee beans shortly after I started using this grinder. Thanks to this purchase, Iâ??m back to buying pre-ground coffee. Gimme my old grinder back! Recommendation: against all reviews, do not buy.^1.00
B00004SPEU^R55JRZNZ2G0KD^Great little coffee grinder, perfect for a cramped kitchen^A37X2ZA77I5NIF^2016-01-18^ This is my first ever coffee grinder and I chose this one because of the low cost and the compact design. It has been fantastic addition to our kitchen. We have fresh ground coffee every day, so delicious! It is incredibly easy to use, not too noisy and so compact, I can tuck it away in the corner and it takes up no space. My only complaint is that it is fairly easy to spill some on the counter when opening the top after you\re done grinding. I\m not sure if this is a universal problem with grinders or the design of this one. I just try to be extra careful to minimize spillage. So happy I chose this grinder.^5.00
B00004SPEU^R28TEH927A7SKN^The FERRARI of grinders. Spend the extra money and get this, it cannot be beaten.^A1TH3GVQ6TOMTA^2016-01-21^ When you are looking for a grinder you do not realize how important they are until you get this one. Then you grind your first cup of beans, and OMG. This little machine is unbeatable. It is like the ferrari of Grinders. 5 seconds and you have a perfect ground blend ready to make your day start off with a Bang. I used some in the military that actually stunk, they were slow, got stuck, not this one. This one takes a mundane task and makes it extra ordinary. I will use a Krups for the rest of my life no doubt about it.^5.00

I have to turn the grinder upside down and tap with a spoon to get the ground coffee out of the grind chamber, and there is a reside of coffee left on the lid as well as the chamber. You cannot adjust the grind and the top can be difficult to remove at times. I have to use a damp paper towel to clean the unit every time I use it which is a pain.^3.00
B00004SPEU^RZSRANTKZV2MI^NOT For Coffee Grinding^A7T9C8M6GW9JT^2016-01-15^ Pros: +Easy to use +Compact design +Reasonably priced Cons: -This should only be used for grinding spices. I do not suggest using this for coffee. You will NOT get a consistent texture/grain size. Buy a burr grinder for your coffee beans instead. -Difficult to clean the blade fully (especially underneath the blade). You\ll have to use a pipe cleaner or a thin piece of fabric.^3.00
B00004SPEU^R1DNJ48T4SP96W^I have BEAN wanting this grinder for so long!^A3AGGK16JQ7UWC^2015-12-31^ I have had this on my wish list for a while and got this for Christmas from my Father-n-Law. We both love coffee and love the strange brews from all over the world. I have a different coffee maker than he does so this will come in great use when I give him coffee. I ground my first batch already. I didnt grind the whole bag because that will ruin the flavr of the bean.^5.00

The earlier model still worked well, but it looked awful after years of use and some accidents. I expect this model will last as long ... it certainly does the job well. I detect no loss of quality from the earlier model. I use mine for grinding spices, and just occasionally for grinding coffee beans.^5.00

I bought 3 bags of whole bean coffee online by mistake and didn\t want to return them so I bought this grinder. It\s fast, easy to use, and the cleanup is simple. I don\t know how long this sort of appliance usually lasts but regardless, it\s cheap enough that I wouldn\t mind replacing it after a few years. Wonderful buy!^5.00
B00004SPEU^R2JZ1VG50RN0KC^It actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder^A3TWPRY7YFWYM3^2016-01-18^ This works well for small quantities. It actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder, which has several settings. That said, this grinds finely so if you need a coaster grind, this may not be ideal. It arrived in proper packaging and has been in use for nearly a year and still performs wonderfully.^5.00
B00004SPEU^R4RDC5Q1KPDUQ^Good, not great^A1EI2UTRU0QCJQ^2016-01-18^ This is a pretty good coffee grinder, but coffee tends to pack around the edges of the inside, requiring a utensil to scrape the coffee out. Also, if you\re doing a fine grind, it\s sometimes hard to get very fine unless you fill it at least 2/3. But generally works well, and no problems with the motor.^4.00
B00004SPEU^RULS2C346ZJ7K^Strong little grinder, strange lid design^A15PUBCS4N4G60^2015-12-26^ Strong little grinder and works as you would expect. The issues are with the actual lid. To get the food/coffee from the top you will ned to turn the whole thing upside dow and pat the machine to get it all out without a huge mess. Not a big deal but that great of a design^4.00
B00004SPEU^R3MAXFBV4JY54I^The grinder works great and you\ll get very fine powder^A3OXNEJIAOUW5Q^2015-12-27^ I bought this for grinding dried peppers for jerky and curry making.

B00004SU18^REVC0JMRSH82E^... Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\m doing here right now)^A1Y6TY3D6HBA6T^2016-01-14^ I had the same problem that others on Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\m doing here right now). I just purchased this same filter from Walmart recently along with a brand new Brita water pitcher (yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each other...and the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well). I thought I was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing; and watching the \dirty\ water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir I just cringed and scratched my head... After triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly, I pushed so darn hard that I was ready for the unit to break, the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housing...and alas, water still leaks through and the filter clearly does NOT seal well with this unit. I find it almost humorous that I only came here to read these Amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after I decided to Google my problem and see if there was a magic solution, and I see Brita repeatedly replying with we\re sorry! call our customer service and we will help!...or you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down. If you go onto Brita\s website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there, you will ALSO find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass through...along with the same sad responses from Brita support which seemingly makes Brita look like they\re being proactive. Unfortunately as in this case, sometime\s replying with the same canned responses that don\t really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well; clearly Brita is in denial or won\t publicly accept fault for this issue. I think the worst part in all of this though, is that there are likely many consumers who get their new Brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old Brita filters worked, and they don\t even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesn\t seal properly/completely in a water-tight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus. So all of the great things Brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this. You\re buying a filter to clean your water, you don\t even notice its NOT cleaning your water, and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightly-less-dirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesn\t seal well. The essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter ALL of the water, not just most of it...if the product can\t filter 99.99999% of the water being poured into it, then it is most certainly a defective product. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Brita that they aren\t purposely and knowingly selling a defective filter-design, it\s still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isn\t lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters. FYI, Brita Customer Service, if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct, we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews, and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly, properly, and easily sealed when inserted...then I know you haven\t read or care about what I say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue. No need for me to call Brita customer service either, I\m going to buy a filter now from your competitor and I can only hope it works the way it should. Thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your CEO and COO and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet.^1.00
B00004SU18^R3MNKB2OJWODVN^I love Brita Filters!^A2PPZVV49HJ3L2^2016-01-11^ I bought my brita pitcher years ago, and the filters looked different when I first bought it so I was nerves that my pitcher was too old and it would not fit. But, it was no problem since these filters fit perfectly. The top of these filters look different. It has a thinner top. I love it because it is easier to grab and take out of the pitcher. The old filters I had to struggle with to get out. Sometimes I had to disassemble to top of the pitcher and push the filter from underneath. These new filters seem to get rid of that problem! Also, there is barely any pre-soaking required! I got these out of the package expecting to soak them in a bowl for several hours, but the instructions said to just rinse it for a few seconds. So no more having to get a bowl out for filter replacements! The quality of the water is good too; I donâ??t notice any difference in the quality of water from the old filters. The price is reasonable. I got a five pack for $24.56. This comes out to under 13 cents per gallon if I use the recommended 40 gallons per filter.^5.00
B00004SU18^RJYAVOY3TFF56^I use these filters in my Brita pitcher to transfer ...^A2DOUN6J6RVNC5^2016-01-09^ I use these filters in my Brita pitcher to transfer the filtered water into my 5 gallon jug that sits on the cooler. I refuse to spend $12 for 5 gallons of spring water I have no idea if it really is spring water. I let my water sit open for 24 hours or more prior to filtering so the chlorine can vaporize and leave the water. This allows the filters to last longer.^5.00
B00004SU18^R1JZ58QSEFTRCC^Only good for chlorine^A33DE72RERV7EL^2016-01-14^ I have a water tester and my water tested with as many or more particles after using the filter. It does get rid of the chlorine and they put a lot of chlorine in our water (rural water system).^2.00
B00004SU18^R41AAT0FLMOAY^Non-Brita filters and they just aren\t as good unfortunately. These new Brita filters also do not ...^A1HVMH4UAEF1DX^2016-01-20^ Tried the cheaper, Non-Brita filters and they just aren\t as good unfortunately. These new Brita filters also do not require a 15 minute soak in water,. you instead just run cold water over the water filter now for 15 seconds and it is ready to go. Also, there are so far a lot less black flecks in the top of the Brita canister and the water tastes great. Overall, to save a $1.50-2 (ish) dollars, the off-brand filters are just not worth it, my guess is they do not contain as much activated charcoal, I base this on my vast knowledge of water filter technology and science background that comes with being a communications major, so basically, nothing, but the filter is great.^5.00
B00004SU18^RZO4G67JCBHUV^Love the quality of the water.^A12RGUI6K7I2RA^2016-01-14^ I do not buy bottled water! I drink tap water---sometimes funny tasting tap water---hold yer nose Sulfur water that I\m told is good for me. Um. But! Two years ago I was gifted with a Brita Pitcher. It really makes a difference. I soon needed replacement filters because I followed manufacturer\s instructions. DON\T FOLLOW MANUFACTURE\S INSTRUCTIONS! I\ve found that I can use Brita filters for many months and the water quality is crystal clear and without any unpleasant taste. I only replace filters when the filter gets clogged up.^5.00
B00004SU18^R3KIPO8JNH8PUA^Now they made so it\s very easy to get out and you do not have to ...^A356O8QBYH0NR7^2016-01-21^ I started using the Brita water Pitcher over 5 years ago. I always complained about how hard it was to remove the filter from the pitcher, until now. Thank jesus for R&D. Now they made so it\s very easy to get out and you do not have to soak it in a glass of water anymore. These filter works great and you can really tell the difference when drinking water. No chlorine taste and no charcoal flakes floating around in the water. Good price great product. I only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars are meant for angels and gods.^4.00

I purchased this filter so as to remove the unpleasant taste of tap water, this filter only diminishes the taste as much of the water still gets through unfiltered as this does not accurately fit my pitcher.^2.00
B00004SU18^R232ZWLN6KRSAU^Refreshing!^A27M7SEVQ9Y91^2016-01-21^ Yeah, this is a Brita review, because why?

B00004SU35^R3BUOCQCJDYF0W^Great product. Be careful with stirring it when you ...^A1N5PJMIRP5D9G^2016-01-01^ Great product. Be careful with stirring it when you are making Carmel/sweet corn. The handle has a plastic gear on it and that can break if you twist it too hard or too fast. I love making my own popcorn with olive oil, and a little salt. You don\t need to buy their brand of popcorn. They are great tasting but they are expensive. DO NOT buy another brand of ready to use popcorn oil and salt bags. If they are cheap, they will taste horrible. Just use regular popcorn, one tablespoon popcorn to one tablespoon olive oil. 4-5 tablespoons for 2 adults. Should be pretty close to perfect. Salt to preference. Great white elephant gift!!!!^5.00
B00004SU35^R3USXK5HZO86X2^There is no better snack on movie night in our house^ABJ8TVKJADK2K^2016-01-20^ Our family loves popcorn! We were buying bags upon bags of popcorn to pop as our night time snack during family time. There is no better snack on movie night in our house. That is why when I saw the Wabash Valley Farms Whirley-Pop I couldn\t wait to try it! I read the mixed reviews and was cautiously optimistic. The product arrived with a 5.5 oz Wabash Valley Real Theater Popcorn all-inclusive kit... WINNING! I was super excited for the bonus popcorn to try out our Whirley-pop for the first time! We made our first batch of popcorn the night it arrived. The directions included were super easy to follow, and in 3 1/2 minutes we had perfectly popped buttery popcorn. Just like that in 3 1/2 minutes I was mom of the year! The Whirley-pop was constructed really well. All the pieces look like they will last a long time. I had read a lot of comments about the gears breaking and I don\t know if the company has improved that piece but mine appear to be extremely solid and well made. I will update again after continued use.^5.00
B00004SU35^R3MDAAB8YKQJ98^Great product otherwise, but you might want to consider this issue.....^A1IDWVP71T94AB^2016-01-18^ I purchased the Whirley-Pop in June 2015 through Amazon, a little over 6 months ago. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it broke within 6 months and the Wabash Valley Farms replacement cost, despite its warranty, is something you might want to consider when you purchase, along with which version of the popper you\d like. I learned from the folks at WVF that the gears on the version Amazon sells are plastic. I hadn\t known there were two versions of this popper available from WVF, one with plastic gears and one with die cast metal gears. WVF said that Amazon opted to sell this version only but I could be upgraded to a replacement cover with the metal gears for an additional cost. Wabash Valley Farms has a 25 year warranty on its products, but it cost me an additional $16+ to upgrade to the metal-geared cover. I thought I should warn other potential customers that, given the REAL cost of a replacement that would last, they might want to purchase the version with the metal gears in the first place.^4.00
B00004SU35^R2R8D70FJ97NM9^I Can Finally Make Popcorn As Good As Grandma\s^A102PS97JPLYGK^2014-04-19^  The Whirley Pop is the best thing since sliced bread!! Ever since I was a little girl I have loved homemade popcorn. My grandmother would make it for us whenever we spent the night. Theater and microwave popcorn cannot hold a candle to Grandma\s popcorn. A friend recently gave us a Whirley Pop popcorn popper. Oh my goodness! This thing is the bomb!! Tonight I made my second batch, and it was as perfect as the first one was. NOT ONE SINGLE UNPOPPED KERNAL! I seasoned the pot per the enclosed instructions before first use. For both batches I used 3 Tablespoons vegetable oil and one half cup Orville Redenbocker\s Original Gourmet Popping Corn. Both batches turned out perfectly. I attached video to demonstrate how easy it is to use and the amount of popcorn in a single batch.^5.00
B00004SU35^R17CS3MLOFY9IV^Awesome tasting popcorn^A1YQ8ZX7YWA5SB^2016-01-14^ I had recently tried Kettle Korn and fell in love with the salty and sweet taste. I tried to recreate it at home but just burnt my pots, twice. I looked up some recipes and came across a clip of Martha Stewart making some with the Whirley-Pop. After watching the video I placed an order for it. When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a bag of popcorn with butter. I tried to make the kettle corn again and this time, it was a success. I have also made regular butter popcorn successfully. If you do kettle corn, add the sugar and salt a minute after you put all the corn kernels in, They will be a whitish color, that\s the best time to add it in.^5.00
B00004SU35^R2A95EZGBWSGYO^but I feel like that\s a small price to pay^A7BLFQ5QGERVK^2016-01-09^ This popcorn popper is simple, but works so well! I received it as a gift and I won\t make popcorn with anything else. I use 1/2 cup of Pop Secret popcorn and a little bit of corn oil and I get 10 cups of perfectly popped popcorn. Every time. I just made some and had just one unpopped kernel. The only downside is that you have to hand wash lid/handle, but I feel like that\s a small price to pay. Love it...highly recommend!!^5.00
B00004SU35^R2NT92XQV480WJ^cheap metal but fun to use^A51DWA4NM73FR^2016-01-12^ what keeps me from loving it is the material used. it feels like thin cheap metal that will damage pretty quickly, i.e. burn marks that won\t clean up as well as a pain to clean on the inside. waiting to see what happens 5 uses in, but so far so good. just wish the metal was a little more sturdy or thick/firm.^4.00
B00004SU35^R10SPG0SS0WFB9^Ruined my stovetop^A9OE4ER9RI2ZV^2016-01-16^ I bought this product because I knew it would be far healthier than microwave popcorn. It scratched the hell out of my stovetop with one use. I never moved the pan, just twirled. The bottom of the pan appeared to not be flat. It wobbled all over the burner. Don\t buy this product if you value you stove.^1.00
B00004SU35^RMA1KNFV9B9OG^Best present ever! (my wife\s words!)^A1KGIAODIV8OCJ^2016-01-18^ I bought this as a surprise for my popcorn loving wife. Her words, one of the be presents ever! She is beyond pleased with the quality of the popping and taste of the popcorn. It works just the way it is described and eliminates clean up too! If you like popcorn, you will love the Whirley-Pop!^5.00

He bought me a new pot for Christmas :) This popcorn maker is awesome for folks who just don\t like the taste of air popped. the handle is connected to a wire I believe he\s used the thing every day since Christmas.^5.00

I use jiffy pop kernels or Orville Reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn. Cabot Cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal. Its like crack, you can\t stop eating it.^5.00
