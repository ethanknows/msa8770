       "[' My skin has never looked better! Received just three days ago and I\\\\ve used it about four or five times (once before I go to bed, and once when I wake up in the morning). Smells amazing and doesn\\\\t dry out my skin. The before and after pictures speak for themselves. Great product and a great price! Top is before and bottom is after.  I remembered my granny used rose petal and witch hazel and I ordered and WOW!!!! It is a seven Natural wonder,I have ordered my second one, my skin looks like 25 five years ago (I am 60) I used it before my serum and my night cream.  I am in love with this toner. I have super sensitive skin with occasional hormonal breakouts and this helps soothe everything. I have even noticed that the breakouts are less severe when I use this on a regular basis. I am a forever fan!  I purchased this product with the intentions of it clearing my small amount of zits and helping in keeping my face hydrated seeing how many people who used it had great results from this.After receiving this bottle of Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera,I was disappointed in seeing how the bottle came really dirty looking.Its also a little chipped in the cap but it didn\\\\t spill or anything which is fine with me.The smell alone makes me melt.It smells so darn good.After using it just once on my face,it felt so hydrated.Feels so fresh.I absolutely fell in love with the scent.As I kept on using it,my zits have basically banished.I do have blackheads but other than that,my face is basically clear.They say that Witch Hazel helps fade away dark spots,which is another reason as to why I purchased the product.Hopefully as I continue to use this,my dark spots from previous acne will fade away.  I\\\\m 55 an have been having terrible issues with cystic acne breakouts on my chin, along with really dry skin. Loreal\\\\s Alcohol Free Hydrating Facial Toner has always worked really really well for me, but has not done anything to alleviate these issues, plus, I\\\\ve been trying to switch over to products from cruelty free companies. This product popped up on Amazon while I was searching for another toner, and the reviews were very good. My sister swears by witch hazel for a ton of uses, so I thought, what the heck, I\\\\ll try it. I\\\\ve only been using it about a week, and so far I like it a lot. It is so gentle, and seems to be helping clear up my skin. It doesn\\\\t dry my skin at all. I\\\\m hoping this continues. My skin is so sensitive and a lot of products really irritate it. I would recommend to try if you have sensitive skin, acne issues, or simply want a gentle, cruelty free toner.  This toner is very gentle and does not have a strong smell to it. I love using it and will continue to purchase it into the future.  My friend recommended this so I ordered it. Love it!! My skin has not had any breakouts and it seems to tone down any redness.  I have been using this toner for about 4 years now and I love it. It never breaks me out it actually calms my skin. I like to use it in the am to remove my nighttime moisturizers like you would a cleansing water. It balances my combo complextion and never strips my skin. I love the light rose scent it\\\\s not over powering at all. I also like how all the tannins are in the witch hazel it really makes for a better skin in my case. A bottle lasts me about 3 months with daily use. I always have backups on hand because it is just that good. If you\\\\re looking for a gentle toner that won\\\\t strip your skin and doesn\\\\t break me out at all. Love this for combo and dry skin I can see it working well. Honestly I\\\\d say all skin types because it\\\\s just so gentle. Definitely a toner to try its one of the best I have ever used.  I love the smell of this stuff. It smells so fresh and clean with a light sent of rose. I use it every day usually twice a day. If my skin feels hot it cools it down. If my skin feels dry and tight I can swipe this on my face and it will feel refreshed and moisturized. Its great for my oily skin and it cleans so well. Even after I do a deep clean ( mud mask and exfoliation) this stuff can still remove dirt left in my skin. I have always heard about how wonderful witch hazel is for your skin but I don\\\\t know why I waited so long to try it. I LOVE this stuff and I don\\\\t think my skin care routine will ever be the same :)  This toner is amazing. I have been using witch hazel for years, but found that the alcohol in most brands was over-drying my skin. I found this brand online on pinterest and decided to try it, since it is alcohol free. I am so happy I did! I tend to wake up with puffy eyes and this helps me look awake, rested, and like I am actually a morning person. It soothes redness and irritation due to acne and leaves my skin smelling like a fresh cut rose. Since using it, I have had fewer breakouts and I can tell the difference in the overall appearance of my skin. This product is the best!  I wish I had taken a before photo. I have really bad acne scarring and within days of using this product along with my acne scar treatment I have seen way more of a difference than just with the treatment I had before. Witch hazel pulls excess dirt out of the skin and helps with puffy eyes, wrinkles, acne, acne scarring, stretch marks, eczema, etc. The fine lines that were forming on my neck have already lessened and it\\\\s helping with my chest wrinkles that were forming from sleeping on my stomach. Best $10 I\\\\ve ever spent and I\\\\ve seen more of a difference from this than any of my $60+ creams/ oils/ treatments I\\\\ve bought. Ordering the 3 bottle package next time.  I\\\\m a guy in my late-20\\\\s with somewhat problematic skin. I used to use Dickinson\\\\s Witch Hazel, but switched to Thayers after I decided the alcohol in Dickinson\\\\s brand was drying out my skin. I use this product as a skin toner as part of my morning regimen. Pros: - Smaller pores in t-zone - Less dirt and blackheads - Nice smell - Leaves face feeling clean Try it out, it\\\\s cheap - if it doesn\\\\t work for you, you won\\\\t feel too bad.  This is the second time I ordered this toner. I have been using it ever since my friend recommended it to me. It has a light rose fragrance that is very soothing. It is a good toner to keep your skin moisturized (but you still need some lotion on top of this). It is a good foundation to give enough of moisture to you face but not greasy at all. I use it without anything else in the summer in the night.  I love this stuff! I started using it in conjunction with a new type of face wash, and soon after my skin began to improve a lot - I still have pimples, but way fewer than I used to. For a while I actually thought the face wash was what was helping most, but when I ran out I couldn\\\\t replace it for a while so just continued to use this and a cheaper face wash - my skin has continued looking awesome!  Thayer\\\\s is known in the wet shave community for making a wonderful non-alcohol based aftershave. This particular one has not only witch hazel, but aloe and rose water. It smells like a spring bouquet and leaves the skin feeling smooth and clean. I recommend this if you are looking for a non-alcohol based A/S. Thayer\\\\s has a wonderful product.  I like this product very much. It\\\\s alcohol free, contains aloe vera and other natural ingredients. It doesn\\\\t dry out my skin and removes the last remaining traces of makeup after I wash my face. The rose petal scent is subtle and not offensive. Another plus is the bottle is plastic, not heavy glass. I will definitely buy this again.  Love this product!! It\\\\s noticeably shrunk my pores and even after I wash my face with face wash and think I got all the dirt off I use this stuff on a cotton ball and I see how much was left on my skin. It\\\\s cleared my face breakouts completely in less than 2 weeks. Amazing atuff.  I like Thayers witch hazel for my sensitive skin. The aloe in it is an added ingredient I haven\\\\t found in other brands of witch hazel, and also is good for dry sensitive skin and minor insect bites. Good seller, with fast shipping makes it a win-win purchase!  I bought this in hopes of reducing redness and razor bumps after shaving my face/neck area. So far I am very pleased and am excited to continue using. I have even noticed that my pores appear to be smaller. Smells great too and fast shipping!  Came in fast. The bottle was little smaller than I thought it would be. But, that is okay. It is going to take forever for me to go through the bottle. I have used it on my face a few times and it feels very nice. I do enjoy this product!  After using this, my face hasn\\\\t felt and looked this great in years. My face is incredibly smooth and balanced now, with most to all of my acne gone! I definitely recommend this product and I will definitely be purchasing this again!  This is by far the best toner I\\\\ve used. I have very sensitive skin that tends to be a bit oily. This toner is gentle without drying, keeps oil at bay, and is helping to even my complexion. Will certainly be buying it regularly.  It arrives in a plastic bottle. After using last night, I woke up to a clean and clear face, without the oiliness I\\\\m usually greeted with (extra plus--my face didn\\\\t feel dry). Would recommend to other buyers.  I love doing my DIY facials or some I bought on here, (I.e. Dead Sea mud mask) and it\\\\s honestly so great! I feel like it hydrates my skin where it needs to, and it evens IG out! Love the smell also.  Exactly the same witch hazel I have been using for years, but now with a better bottle! This is a key component of my soap-free face care, and probably the #1 reason for my great skin. Quick delivery!  I have only been using this product a few days and I already see a difference in my skin. My pores seem much smaller! This is great for sensitive skin, acne-prone skin. So happy I found this product.  This is the first time using a toner since I was a teen. I use a facial oil cleanser and use this afterwards and noticed a difference within the first few days. My new go to.  I always buy this as toner, and it\\\\s great stuff. Smells great, feels great on my skin. I also have been using it to make essential oil sprays which has been great!  I love this product. It is not drying to my skin and helps clear anything left on my face after washing. Has a neutral to refreshing smell unlike plain witch hazel.  This is a very nice witch hazel. I love the rose and the fact that there\\\\s no drying alcohol in it, makes for a lovely, gentle toner. Very recommended!  This toner smells amazing! Just like roses and is very gentle but cleansing to my skin. I usually make my own toner but I\\\\m sold on this one now!  Good product for the price. I have used this for over a year now and i think its good. Not life changing, but definitely the best toner ive tried  So good for my skin and such a treat to wipe on in the morning and night :) Arrived quickly and well packaged. Very happy with seller!  I use this post face-wash and it provides a gentle and refreshing toner that helps keep my skin clean and clear. I highly recommend it!  One word: AMAZING. I have been using this product for about a week now and have noticed dramatic results. After washing my face with a mid soap, followed by a scrub, ,I apply this toner. Before I describe the results, let me just say that this product came nicely packaged and I really liked the inside label! The rose petal scent is very attractive and not overpowering. What I think I like most about this product is that it is alcohol-free and is not harsh on my sensitive skin. Most other toners dry my skin out..this toner actually provides moisture to my skin. Some days, I don\\\\t even apply a moisturizer on afterwards, because my skin is so soft. After just a week, I have noticed a healthy PH balance in my skin. My pores are noticeably smaller, and my skin just looks more even-toned and cleaner. LOVE this product, and will be using it everyday, sometimes twice a day if need be. I will recommend this toner to anyone!  This stuff makes my skin so nice. Warning, I had oily skin so people with less oily skin may dry out if they use it twice a day.  I really really like this product. I have been using this for about 1 week and it leave my skin so clean and moist. love it.  Low price, high quality! Simple ingredients, no alcohol, soothing. Tones and moisturizes. Love it, love it, love it!  Liquid gold. People...buy this product! You won\\\\t be disappointed. Totally transformed my face. Great for Rosacea.  I love this product, I love the scent , the fact that there is no alcohol. I look forward to trying other scents.  Speedy delivery and great product! I use it every night after washing my face and it\\\\s a great natural toner.  I have tried everything, and this is the best! I use it twice a day morning and night for best results.  like everyone else I love this stuff. be sure to get alcohol free unless you want a drying effect.  Very pretty scent but I\\\\m going back to the lavender, simply my preference. Alcohol free.  Love this stuff! Makes my face feel super clean and smooth! Will be repurchasing!  Love it! Really great product and will definitely continue to buy this product!!  Love all Thayer witch hazel products. This is my personal favorite. Great toner  I love it it smells wonderful and it makes my skin look and feel great!  I was scared of getting this product at first because of the bad reviews saying they would make your face breakout or make it oily, but this product did wonders for me. i have an evenly balanced face, not too oily and not too dry; however every single time I get my eyebrows threaded, tons of pimples break out around my eyebrows the next day. I used this product for 3 days before I got my eyebrows threaded and on the day I got them threaded, and absolutely no breakouts around my eyebrows or anywhere else on my face. 10/10  This toner smells SO NICE. I actually look forward to using it.  Got this for my mother and she said it felt nice on her face  Absolutely the best I have tried. It leaves my skin sooo soft and clean. I use it on my eyes to gently wipe away any liner after I wash my face and it just is beyond words how much better my skin is using this product. The bottle had a little hole in it but none spilled out in the box it came in. It was just when I grabbed the bottle I noticed some spillage, but I had an empty squeeze bottle I use for toners so it was fine.  I pour this on a cotton pad and wipe my face after cleansing. It visibly tightens the pores, which is what I hoped for. It has a nice rosy scent. I swapped my old Dickinson witch hazel for this because it\\\\s alcohol-free. I have combination/dry skin, so I have to use moisturizer, but anyone who uses toners should be doing so anyway. And it also wipes away any trace of makeup that has failed to leave my face...It\\\\s great!  Works well with my skin. I use it on a daily bases.  This was received quickly and in great shape from the seller. I love the smell and how gentle it is. It seems to be very good on my face and I am already halfway through the bottle (it\\\\s been a few months) so I know it\\\\s definitely non irritating. I have very sensitive skin that is going through a lot of changes (post-partem and nursing), this has helped balance my skin.  This product is great- it smells really nice and makes my skin feel very soft and refreshed. I was hoping it would help with my acne (I have a few small breakouts here and there) but it has not really done much for that--still working on getting the right combo of products/ routine. But I like that this is natural product and has been around for a while, would recommend.  Excellent toner.Cleans without striping your skin  I love this product! It makes my face feel refreshed & diminshes the puffiness under my eyes. The price is affordable compared to high end products that contain tons of chemicals. It feels good knowing that I\\\\m using something with natural ingredients, and that it actually works!  It seems to be clearing up my acne!!!! :) :)  i like it , i think i will buy it again.  A great astringent... and smells lovely!  good condition, very useful~  Soft rose scent. Works well.  I thought the rose scent would be too much, but its not and it dissipates pretty quickly. My face seems better already (my chin hasn\\\\t broken out since starting to use it) so I\\\\m happy, and it\\\\s a big bottle.  Nothing is better. I use it every night after I cleanse my face. I apply to a cotton round and it removes anything the cleansing missed. Then I moisturize. Fabulous fragrance. Fabulous product.  Never stung my skin :) even when water stings This didNOT! If I had open cuts, rashes, wounds, etc it soothes with no pain\\xc2\\xa1 Gentle. Calms down & moisturizes  I didn\\\\t have acne as a teenager but now have this pesky adult acne and honestly this witch hazel has been an absolute godsend!  Seems to work well as a toner without drying out or irritating my skin.  It works perfectly but do not go overboard with the witch hazel.  Smells great, works very well, has a lot of benefits for my skin  Just as I expected, refreshing, with a light smell of Rosewater. I\\\\ll be using this product extensively in my travels to the Middle East, where temps can reach 114 degrees. Not as harsh as other facial astringents, it\\\\s unique blend of traditional witch Hazel and Rosewater was what I was looking for.  Excellent product Looks like the label is a little old  I found a new love in toner. Love the light rose sent.  Smells great and I can tell a difference in one use.  Does a great job on my skin, without drying it out  Came in different (newer?) packagin\\xc3\\xa2?? red top and a shorter, rounder bottle. From what I can tell, it still works as well as my first purchase. It doesn\\\\t leave my skin too dry since it is alcohol-free. LOVE the rose scent!  Leaves my face feeling so soft ! I love it  I love this ! It\\\\s Great for your face.  I just received it and used it last evening! I love the way it smells like roses plus it was gentle on my skin. I would recommend this to anyone for their facial care! Love it  Love this product. I use it as a toner and have since a noticeable difference in my skin. Will be recommending this products to my sisters.  It\\\\s suitable for my oil skin  Love this stuff for my face. I use it almost every night and can already tell such a different in my skin. Would highly recommend!  Love the texture and smell.  The aloe is a great substitute for alcohol. Does not dry out skin and smells amazing. Worth the price, lasts a long time.  Feels and smells good.  Fast and easy! Thanks!  Loved it. Buying more.  rose smell! I love it!  Fantastic! I love it.  Use daily and love it  I like the smell .  Natural and gentle  Love this product.  I love this stuff!  Love this product!  I like this product for toning my skin and make it fairer than before.  Great product !  I received the product on time and was just as I expected.  Great product  Great product  As described  goooooooood  Good stuff  i love it  love it!  I love it to much \\xc3\\xb0???\\xc3\\xb0???  Good  Bought this product for my teenagers to use with their facial cleaning regiment. We are using it as a toner.  I use this religiously! love the product great as a cleaner, toner and moisturizer!  Solid  great  good',\n",
       " ' This thing can grind! It has ground up everything I have placed in it with ease! Now the bad stuff. The unit is really really hard to clean. The only way to keep it clean is to wash it after every use. I use it to grind up foods I have dehydrated. It has powdered up sweet peppers, carrots, kale, beets, lime, ginger, and turbinado sugar. So after each use I had to clean it up. It was a big chore due to not having any napkins! I bought a brush to clean it but it isn\\\\t the best thing and you will need to put some water in it to get the dust out from the bottom of the blade. The unit does seem to be waterproof but I am not trying to find out. It did shoot water out from the lid so I learned really fast to only place a small amount in there at a time as to allow the particles stuck under the blade to remove themselves. The unit itself is surprisingly heavy. After a few uses it stopped working but with a few shakes it would turn on. I believe it stopped working due to the lid not being down all the way. I want to process coffee beans at least once to see the end results but from my experience I don\\\\t know how anyone could get anything but a fine grind. It seems to powder everything in seconds. In seconds you can see powder forming on the lid. I have no idea how I would get a coarse grind with the KRUPS. Maybe the result is different with coffee beans than with dehydrated food. I imagine I would have to pulse it for no longer than a second. This is exactly what I was looking for though in the end so I give it 5 stars.  Replaced a really old grinder of similar type by Cusinart, This one works great and I like it since it has a larger capacity for beans so I can grind more at once. Of course the grind depends on how long you hold the button down. I like mine ground fine for an espresso machine. Some powder tends to cake under the blades. I have developed a habit of holding it up when I push the button and tilt it sideways back and forth during grinding to facilitate mixing. One would do well to count the seconds for the grind you like so to be more consistent over time. I believe it takes about 10 seconds to get to a fine enough grind. After done I put the gound coffee into a small can making a day or two\\\\s worth at one time so it is always fresh. One needs to use their finger or another object to get the caked product out of the bottom but it is not a big deal. It is easy to clean with a paper towel around the inside tapping the remainder out. I found a small brush which I use to get grind out of the crevasses. Overall I find it is a great value and works well for small portions.  I buy and use whole spices from a health food store. It is fresher and cheaper than packaged spices on the grocery shelves. It allows me the flexibility to purchase exact amounts for a particular recipe without wasting the unused portions. Instead of buying individual spice mills I wanted one mill that could do all types of grinding, coarse or fine. I went to America\\\\s Tedt Kitchen website to read their reviews. This product was 5 star rated. Knowing I could trust their experience and review I purchased the mill. It livesup to its claim! It has a removable cup for easy pouring and cleaning. It\\\\s the only spice mill I need. And yes, it does awesome with coffee beans, nuts, etc. I highly recommend this product! It is easy, quick, and produces an even grind.  This is my first ever coffee grinder and I chose this one because of the low cost and the compact design. It has been fantastic addition to our kitchen. We have fresh ground coffee every day, so delicious! It is incredibly easy to use, not too noisy and so compact, I can tuck it away in the corner and it takes up no space. My only complaint is that it is fairly easy to spill some on the counter when opening the top after you\\\\re done grinding. I\\\\m not sure if this is a universal problem with grinders or the design of this one. I just try to be extra careful to minimize spillage. So happy I chose this grinder.  When you are looking for a grinder you do not realize how important they are until you get this one. Then you grind your first cup of beans, and OMG. This little machine is unbeatable. It is like the ferrari of Grinders. 5 seconds and you have a perfect ground blend ready to make your day start off with a Bang. I used some in the military that actually stunk, they were slow, got stuck, not this one. This one takes a mundane task and makes it extra ordinary. I will use a Krups for the rest of my life no doubt about it.  I have had this on my wish list for a while and got this for Christmas from my Father-n-Law. We both love coffee and love the strange brews from all over the world. I have a different coffee maker than he does so this will come in great use when I give him coffee. I ground my first batch already. I didnt grind the whole bag because that will ruin the flavr of the bean.  Bought this one to replace an earlier model that I\\\\d been using since 1978. The earlier model still worked well, but it looked awful after years of use and some accidents. I expect this model will last as long ... it certainly does the job well. I detect no loss of quality from the earlier model. I use mine for grinding spices, and just occasionally for grinding coffee beans.  This is great! I bought 3 bags of whole bean coffee online by mistake and didn\\\\t want to return them so I bought this grinder. It\\\\s fast, easy to use, and the cleanup is simple. I don\\\\t know how long this sort of appliance usually lasts but regardless, it\\\\s cheap enough that I wouldn\\\\t mind replacing it after a few years. Wonderful buy!  This works well for small quantities. It actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder, which has several settings. That said, this grinds finely so if you need a coaster grind, this may not be ideal. It arrived in proper packaging and has been in use for nearly a year and still performs wonderfully.  I bought this for grinding dried peppers for jerky and curry making. The grinder works great and you\\\\ll get very fine powder, be careful though as the dust can get in the air quite easily and like me you\\\\ll be end up with a runny nose, sneezing for 15 minutes or so, oops.  Love this spice grinder! It works on everything, literally. Plus, when I have to grind coffee beans occasionally for relatives, the smell doesn\\\\t linger inside afterward as long as I clean it well with a wet cloth. No complaints!  Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it! It\\\\s incredibly easy to use (one button operation!) Easy to clean as well. Plus it makes the kitchen smell great while it\\\\s grinding coffee beans :)  So far so good. I initially bought a hand grinder - ceramic type to keep the coffee as pure as possible.., but I found that it was taking WAY too long to grind. This is a good, fast solution.  This is a nice, simple little grinder. You can\\\\t grind huge batches of coffee at a time, but that\\\\s fine for us. I haven\\\\t used it for spices, yet, but I\\\\m sure it will work great when I do.  This product is excellent. Its inexpensive and made with quality. Its a great coffee grinder. There are no fancy settings. You control the type of grind manually. But its very easy use.  I purchased this to replace a coffee grinder that I previously had for 10 years. I have used this for coffee and spices. Works great. Runs smoothly and quietly.  Excellent tool. We had it for over a year with no problems. Does a good job grinding coffee does not heat the grounds too much and keeps the oils and flavores in.  I bought this for my son and he loves it. It grinds the coffee beans perfectly and fast. He really likes the fact this grinder also grinds spices too!  We own two of these. One for spices and one for coffee. They work great and are super easy to clean (we just use a little bit of dried rice).  My first time ever using this or grinding coffee. So easy! Coffee is so much better and fresher! I love this size because it\\\\s only for me.  I love this product. It\\\\s small so it\\\\s easy to store, it\\\\s quick and efficient and not very loud. And I got it for a great price.  I use this to pulverize my dehydrated hot peppers from my garden. Grinds them into the finest dust. Just what I needed.  I use it every morning. Works great! I put 8 Tbsp of coffee beans in it. Takes about 10s to turn them into a fine powder.  Does the job perfectly. Nice shape for pouring directly into coffee maker once chopped. Great price, recommend highly.  Basic coffee grinder, not very loud, grinds beans perfectly, use daily, clean with a small unused makeup brush.  Just purchased and I really like it so far. It\\\\s super simple design and low noise makes for a great grinder =)  Perfect and powerful!! Just what i needed to get the most nutrients out of the nuts!!ayay i am in love!! Thanks  I grind spices and nuts with ease !! Even grind oats to make flour ... This is the best kitchen tool yet !!!  Works perfectly as advertised. Used for the freshest coffees\\\\ taste and aroma! Grinds spices well too.  Worked extremely well on dried muscadine grape seeds. Was very happy with our ground flax seeds.  Cheap, works well. This little thing is dependable and perfectly grinds my coffee beans.  Love this grinder. High quality and grinds perfectly. Very happy with this product.  been griding coffee for a year without any problems. makes for a nice even grind.  This works great for me; I found no need of a timer and the grind is perfect.  Been using to grind my chaga to put in a tea bag. Works like a charm.  Turns whole beans into fresh ground coffee. Excellent grinder.  Small solution to grinding coffee with less counter space.  Wonderful! Simple, works very well, and very good value.  Use this to cut corners prepping in the restaurant!!  Good purchase. very satisfied with the quality.  A year and half later, still works great!!!!!  Works well enough for its price. No issues.  Works really, really well. As expected.  essential for good living!! I love it!!  GREAT GIFT LOVED IT! ARRIVED FAST!  Works great. Used as a Spice Mill.  Used it for years and it\\\\s great!  so far so good after 3 months  i\\\\ve been using it a lot  very quick and efficient  Grinds coffee perfectly.  Powerful, work good.  Nice worked great.  Works as expected  Perfect Grinder!  great product!  great grinder  great product  Does the job.  Works great  GREAT VALUE  it grinds!!  Perfect!  Really great product. I use it for spices, coffee, truvia. It makes it into a fine powder. LOVE IT!!',\n",
       " ' the air popper does just what you think. it pops a big bowl of popcorn in just about 4 minutes, with no added oil. this is great for you health conscience folks. We use a little olive oil spray on our popcorn once it lands in the bowl to flavor it up a bit. no messy pots.  I got it today and made my first batch. I love it! I\\\\m very impressed. The same popcorn I use to pop in a steel pot with lid, pops much larger and fluffier. No more using oil or washing pans. I highly recommend it.  I should write a review for those of you who have their doubts about the efficiency of yet another kitchen product. I am pathologically spartan and prefer a life with fewer kitchen products. I tossed the big coffee maker, the kitchen aid etc. I use a french press and mix rarely, but by hand. YET, I fully love and embrace this popcorn maker. Hubby no longer burns the popcorn! It pops EVERY KERNEL! It\\\\s amazing! I think we\\\\ve had it about a year, maybe a year and a half and it performs regularly (weekly at least) and flawlessly. And it was CHEAP! (You just plug it in and away it goes - no dials, no settings; butter dish on top works by warming the butter from the ambient heat from the popcorn popper and it works fine.)  Don\\\\t know why I\\\\ve been eating less healthy and less flavorful microwave popcorn for all these years. The Presto hot air popcorn popper has quickly become the most used appliance in the kitchen. Works perfect every time. 10 seconds faster then using our microwave. Very easy to clean. Make sure you use a BIG bowl because the 1/2 cup of kernels may not look like much but makes a lot of popcorn. I like drizzling with olive oil afterwords so the salt sticks. Otherwise, all the salt will just end up on the bottom of the bowl. Healthier though not as tasty. Extremely happy with the purchase of my Presto!  Works way better than the other hot air poppers I\\\\ve had. Pops far more of the kernels - almost all - than any other. The instructions say to not preheat but it works better when you do; simply remove the hood while you\\\\re doing it. It does tend to blow out some kernels initially; I tilt the whole thing back until it starts popping and that prevents that. If all that sounds too fiddly consider that the results with this popper are simply far better than with others; they suffer from the same small problems this one has and add in major problems of their own (like all those unpopped kernels!).  After you load the popcorn in the yellow part hole, you plug it in and the air heats it up and you put a bowl under the opening and literally out shoots flying hot popcorn. Meanwhile the tip top part is heating your butter. It takes a while though to heat the butter. Sometimes all of your popcorn can be completely popped and you still have half heated butter. When the popcorn is finished spitting out all of the popped corn you just unplug it and that shuts it off.  We love popping popcorn in this popper. We use it at least once a week, and it\\\\s great knowing what\\\\s in the popcorn, rather than hoping that the microwave stuff won\\\\t kill you. It\\\\s super easy to use, seems to pop nearly all of the kernels every time, and has a place to melt butter for the popcorn. Get a big bowl, because they recommend popping 1/2 cup of kernels (the size of the included scoop/butter container), and that makes a very large bowl of popcorn.  We eat a lot of popcorn and have gone through many popcorn poppers. We have only used this for 2 weeks but compared to the air poppers we have had in the past this one has been superior. From the time we first put the 1/2 cup of kernels in to when it is done is less than 4 minutes. We do this 4 times to get 2 very large bowls of popcorn. The only thing that would have been nice on it is an ON/OFF switch.  I got this for my 4 year old grandson who just loves to cook. They used it the first night it arrived and they were tickled with the results. My daughter especially loves the the fact that she can pop the corn without the need for oil. Wonderful, healthy choice. The quality is as expected and appears sturdy enough for the price. We are pleased.  I bought this popper for three of my adult married kids for Christmas, as a family gift. They all loved it. The grandkids love watching the popcorn pop. Orville Red. Organic popcorn worked well. Tastes better than microwave popcorn and healthier too! It\\\\s a popcorn popper and works well...don\\\\t over think it people...LOL  An excellent popper. I pop the corn into a 12qt Cambro container, melt butter in the microwave, and then put the lid on the container and shake it up. Olive oil is also very good. For best results, use finely ground salt (I use a spice grinder for this purpose).  We love this popper. I bought one as a gift for Christmas and just purchased another one this week so that my kids and I can enjoy all natural popcorn at home without any chemicals, preservatives, etc.. The kids like to pop it all by their self.  Excellent popcorn popper. Can make smaller or larger batches and all the kerrnals pop. Making smaller batches in our old popper prevented all the kernals from popping. With just the two of us, normally we make smaller batches.  Got this for our 1st grade niece for Christmas and it was a trip seeing her excitement! This was her favorite gift at Christmas...her own popcorn maker! Hilarious! It worked great and we got to enjoy the popcorn she made!  West Bend Air Crazy 4-Qt Popcorn Popper was originally purchased from Walmart. I took it back the next day very poor performance. But the Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper worked great the very first time and every time!  Love making popcorn now. Just fill the cup, turn it on. No mess, no burning, no cleanup! Healthier popcorn cooked on stove or microwave. I save the extra in a ziplock to enjoy later.  This corn popper works great. It was very reasonably priced and compact. The popcorn comes out just fine. It requires a large bowl to be placed under the hopper.  It works! It\\\\s simple to use and doesn\\\\t make a mess. Having returned another brand because it didn\\\\t work - this works perfectly. No oil. Just corn!  Works great love having fresh popcorn and it is so fast and easy. Probably the only bad thing is doesn\\\\t have a on off switch that u just plug it in.  Works awesome! I have used it several times. Just get a large bowl to capture all the popped corns. My 7 year old is fascinated by them flying out!  Definitely brings back a lot of childhood memories. This is a classic, how can you go wrong. Love the melted butter on top for the finishing touch!  Ordered this for my parents because we\\\\ve had ours for over 10 years and they love it as much as we love ours! I\\\\m jealous of the red color! !  Made my first batch of popcorn last night. Yummmmmm. My family told me it was just as good, if not better than movie theater popcorn. Win!  Perfect popcorn every time Tried other brands prior to this one and this one is the best by far Great tasting popcorn and very healthy  It doesn\\\\t leave many seeds behind. The cup to melt butter on top works, but I prefer to just do it in the microwave. No complaints.  We love the machine, we purchased it a year ago and we use it a lot and it\\\\s still working great. definitely worth the money.  Works great! I had it for few moths now and I use it at least 3 times a week. Very good product and the popcorns, perfect!  Love popcorn. Get a healthy snack in no time. Using hot air no added stuff. I use organic corn and it pops it well.  Kids love this thing. They love watching it make popcorn. Its nice that it is air popped as well. Good price.  Works great. Bought two other brands neither of which worked very well and left a lot of unpopped kernels.  I love this thing! I use this over bagged pop corn and I won\\\\t ever go back. It pops very well!  LOVE IT! It is so easy to make great tasting popcorn...no move microwave popcorn for us!  Great corn popper for the price. Pops nearly every kernel in less than 3 minutes.  Delivered on time. Looks and works exactly as described. Great healthy snacking.  Works super fast, but there is no on and off so it could be a fire hazard.  Love our new popcorn maker!!! Works great. Nothing to complain about.  Great product....works exactly as expected  Love traditional popcorn over microwave  Works great and pops almost every seed.  The popcorn is better then you think...  Love it! Works great! Great price!  Works great and saves the calories  Love this..... great product  safer than microwave popcorn  Works great everytime!  Does a great job.  very easy to use  Loved it!!  Love it !  Great popper. Works well. It gets a lot of use at my house. Presto products are very reliable.  Thanks!',\n",
       " ' I bought my brita pitcher years ago, and the filters looked different when I first bought it so I was nerves that my pitcher was too old and it would not fit. But, it was no problem since these filters fit perfectly. The top of these filters look different. It has a thinner top. I love it because it is easier to grab and take out of the pitcher. The old filters I had to struggle with to get out. Sometimes I had to disassemble to top of the pitcher and push the filter from underneath. These new filters seem to get rid of that problem! Also, there is barely any pre-soaking required! I got these out of the package expecting to soak them in a bowl for several hours, but the instructions said to just rinse it for a few seconds. So no more having to get a bowl out for filter replacements! The quality of the water is good too; I don\\xc3\\xa2??t notice any difference in the quality of water from the old filters. The price is reasonable. I got a five pack for $24.56. This comes out to under 13 cents per gallon if I use the recommended 40 gallons per filter.  I use these filters in my Brita pitcher to transfer the filtered water into my 5 gallon jug that sits on the cooler. I refuse to spend $12 for 5 gallons of spring water I have no idea if it really is spring water. I let my water sit open for 24 hours or more prior to filtering so the chlorine can vaporize and leave the water. This allows the filters to last longer.  Tried the cheaper, Non-Brita filters and they just aren\\\\t as good unfortunately. These new Brita filters also do not require a 15 minute soak in water,. you instead just run cold water over the water filter now for 15 seconds and it is ready to go. Also, there are so far a lot less black flecks in the top of the Brita canister and the water tastes great. Overall, to save a $1.50-2 (ish) dollars, the off-brand filters are just not worth it, my guess is they do not contain as much activated charcoal, I base this on my vast knowledge of water filter technology and science background that comes with being a communications major, so basically, nothing, but the filter is great.  I do not buy bottled water! I drink tap water---sometimes funny tasting tap water---hold yer nose Sulfur water that I\\\\m told is good for me. Um. But! Two years ago I was gifted with a Brita Pitcher. It really makes a difference. I soon needed replacement filters because I followed manufacturer\\\\s instructions. DON\\\\T FOLLOW MANUFACTURE\\\\S INSTRUCTIONS! I\\\\ve found that I can use Brita filters for many months and the water quality is crystal clear and without any unpleasant taste. I only replace filters when the filter gets clogged up.  Works like it should. Water tastes great filtered with this.  a great price for all three  For perfectly in the Brita slim 5 cup pitcher  Yeah, this is a Brita review, because why? Because these little boxes of charcoal make my disgusting, dirty hot tub smelling municipal chlorine and flouride bath straight from the sewer tap water taste like I\\\\m drinking straight form the freshest mountain stream. These things work wonders!  Works well, it did come loose in the pitcher once and carbon dust came out and settled at the bottom. After repositioning the filter and cleaning the bottom of the pitcher, there was no more carbon dust.  Been buying these replacement filters for years. Great price with this bulk purchase. Really makes my water taste delightful. Also use filtered water in coffee maker and iron.  I got these and ended up splitting them with a friend. Great option instead of getting them from the store. So much cheaper.  Don\\\\t have to soak it like the old ones. No more black specks in the fill tank. I like the improvements.  We live our brita pitcher. The 3 pack was a good deal. We\\\\ll be stocked for a few months now.  These newer style of filter general release less carbon (black sediment) in the water.  Very pleased with my purchase. Exactly what I wanted.  More convenient and cheaper than in stores  My water is even cleaner now all the time.  Perfect you can taste the difference  What can I say, it\\\\s a brita filter.  Easy to use and work as expected.  as expected and at a great price  These do a good job of filtering  Works great and taste great.  Fast delivery, good product  Works as it is supposed to.  Great product + good price!  Typical quality Brita items  Makes the water taste great  You need filter at Beijing.  needed by my Brita machine  GREAT FILTER. GREAT PRICE.  goes well with piture  Very Good, Thanks!  as advertised!  A great buy.  Great Price!  Works great  Very good  Love it.  GREAT!!!  Perfect  works wells  Well, it\\\\s a water filter. Not much to say!  cool stuff',\n",
       " ' These are hands down the best quality bands for the money. I am a 38 year old male and wanted a resistance band set that I could travel with as well as use it at home with my p90 workouts. I specifically wanted bands that were made with high quality material and would not break after a few months. After months of research I pulled the trigger and bought Black Mountain resistance band set. These bands met all of my expectations and more. They are high quality and multiple bands can be combined for added resistance. The travel bag makes it easy to travel with since I am always on the go. My wife always really liked them and we ordered a second set to replace her flimsy less quality bands. Thanks Black Mountain for producing a great product at a fraction of what other competitors are selling them for.  I just got this set yesterday as well as a set from another company so I could compare the quality. The other set seems to be made pretty well, but these from Black Mountain are higher quality. The nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look. I\\\\ve been using resistance bands for years. Not as my sole resistance routine, but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights. Everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they haven\\\\t as they are very effective. As these eventually wear out as they all do in time, I\\\\ll replace them with Black Mountain products again. My only complaint is there is a slip of paper that came with the bands offering me a free orange band, but the phone number given doesn\\\\t seem to connect to anything.  My husband uses these and finds them to be good for his arthritis stretching exercises  Haven\\\\t had it long enough to use all of the components but so far I\\\\m impressed with the quality of the material. I also really like the fact that you can remove and mix/match the bands using the hooks on each end. All in all, so far so good, and they do what they\\\\re meant to do. Will update once I can try the other exercise positions using the door anchor.  I\\\\m not a weight guy and I\\\\ve tried resistance bands in the past and was never that impressed. This product is great. It doesn\\\\t have that flimsy, cheap feel. It feels solid and offers good resistance and is easy to use. I\\\\ve used it now for a while and I will keep on using it instead of throwing it in some drawer to gather dust. I would highly recommend this product for both beginners and veterans. And it is compact enough to take with me on trips  I love this product! Upon first receiving it I was skeptical that these would provide a good workout but I can assure you after doing a little 10 minute workout found on YouTube, these little bands deliver! I was so sore after just a short workout. I highly recommend this product to anyone considering a home exercise product to keep themselves fit.  Excellent packaging. The whole set fits neatly into the carrying bag. Excellent for travel. The bands appear to be of superior quality when compared to SPRI. Connecters work well, as does the door mount. Stacking the bands is easy, and quality control has ensured that the bands are of consistent length. Awesome purchase.  Alot of bang \\xc3\\xb0??\\xc2\\xa5 for the buck. Effective work out without the hassles of changing weight and buying expensive equipment. Best of all you can take it with you when traveling. It comes with a carrying case and has an instruction manual which clearly shows the different exercises and how to set up what is needed.  I purchased these bands to help re-strengthen after shoulder surgery, and have been very happy with them. Quality is excellent. It\\\\s fast and easy to change the handles from one band to another, and the carry-bag has made it easy to take these with me wherever I might travel. Highly recommended.  these were perfect for my home gym. Easier to store and move than dumbbells, and significantly cheaper. The handles and door frame loop are advantages over traditional bands and make them feel more like gym machines than exercise bands.  Great product , I don\\\\t have time to go to the gym and this product is very good because I can take it anywhere. I just started using it with my P90X and it works very well. I\\\\m happy with this product and would recommended to anyone.  Good set of resistance training equipment. My wife and I both use it. Its easy to use and comes with an easy to read guide and is well made and well thought out. Small package stores easily just about anywhere.  My item arrived exactly as advertised. So far I\\\\m pleased with my purchase. The bands seen well made and sturdy and easy use and switch out. The carrying bag is a plus as it nearly holds everything nice and neatly  These are awesome! I love that I can exercise at home and that this equipment is small enough to just tuck away when I\\\\m done. The anchor is the best part as all you need is a door and your good to go! Great set!  I have been using these bands for about 2 months and they are great. I had double shoulder and bicep surgery this year and these bands are perfect for my at home exercises prescribed by my physical therapists.  I use mine for physical therapy. It is truly a well manufactured product. I think the price is right considering the level of excellent construction.I rarely give a 5 star but in this case they deserve it.  Great product!! I love the fact that you can clip multiple bands together for increased resistance. They are great for a quick workout during a work break. Highly recommended...  This is the best set of resistance bands on amazon at an amazing price. They offer great resistance and provide you with plenty of exercises that you can use these bands for.  Really great, quality equipment. I used them as soon as I received and was very happy! Received as promised, packaged well and a nice note from the company - great touch!  These are awesome! They work very well and I would definitely buy again. I love that they stack! And the piece to hold in place on the door is so awesome! Best purchase!  Totally recommend. Great price for quality product! Bands are study and the accessories are what really make this a great buy. Great addition to a home gym!  Wow! This is a complete set, and really all you need for exercise at home. And it\\\\s super portable so you can take it during travel and stay fit.  Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set with Door Anchor, Ankle Strap, Exercise Chart, and Resistance Band Carrying CaseThis resistance band set has very good quality. I really like them. They are colored for different weight. I believe they will last long time.  This has been a great versatile way of exercising while on the road. I\\\\ve used it for a few months now and have no complaints.  this package of bands, grips, ankle strap & door strap give my workouts way more options. easy storage takes up no room.  Great set of bands with a useful beginners manual (and I needed it as a beginner myself). It was a great purchase!  Deilvery timely and accurately. A bit of a run around to get the FREE extra band, but it is what it is.  Good price. Sturdy. Great for working out. I love the book it comes with showing variety of ways to use it  A good inexpensive workout. Great for apartment dwellers. Surprising how it works your core  This is a great travel set and the bag is nice to be able to throw in my travel bag.  Great product, I use it every day. Very convenient and the stack-ability is great.  No Excuses - This is a great quality product and works if you do. Would buy two.  just what it says it is. multiple ways/strengths to stretch. Great price too.  Extremely sturdy set. I didn\\\\t expect this level of quality. Very impressed.  Great product. Handles are easy to switch out and the accessories are great.  Surprisingly durable. They all work perfectly. I\\\\m happy with this purchase  Great set of bands!!! Use them daily, great resistance and durable!!!  Very satisfied love it and cheaper the buying individual bands  Perfect for rehabilitation. I used it for a shoulder. Perfect.  Good quality bands, and the connectors all work properly.  The product work as advertised. I recommend this item.  Love this set. Excellent quality, very easy to ise.  good amount of bans for many workouts. good value  Easy to use, booklet full of workout routines.  Love this product, good quality and price  Great resistance band set for starters!  Perfect. ..meet all my needs  Great for use anywhere!  works well for me  Good quality  all good  \\xc3\\xb0???',\n",
       " ' I had bought one of the little handheld spiralizers and quickly realized I needed something easier. I got this to make zucchini spaghetti, but have also used it for scalloped potatoes, carrot/cucumber Vietnamese style salads and more. Great addition to my kitchen. Cleaning is easy, but I do find the different blade options hard to pull out sometimes... I\\\\m sure I am missing some key leverage point....  After placing my order, I had mixed feelings about this product. Some reviewers stated that the original Paderno spiralizer was easier to use, but I am glad I decided to give this one a try. The blades can be changed easily without risk of cutting yourself and it all stores back nicely. As long as the unit grips to the surface, one should not have to use a lot of force to spiral fruits/vegetables manually. I love using squash and zucchini to replace pasta and other solid fruits are also easy to use. You must try the baked apple crisps recipe!  I love this product so much, I\\\\ve used it practically every day since it has arrived! The plastic is easy to clean - just rinse with hot and cold water as soon as you\\\\re finished spiralizing. I\\\\ve made zoodles (zucchini noodles) and swoodles (sweet potato noodles) and I absolutely love them. This spiralizer is an essential kitchen tool for every plant based eater. One thing is, you have to get used to pressing towards the blade whilst turning the spiralizer handle at the same time. I highly recommend this product.  Love this spiralizer. Bought one for myself, and then one for my best friend, and then my sister, and then another one for me to keep at my parents\\\\ house. It makes quick work of slicing for cucumber salad, potatoes au gratin, onions (for anyone lacking knife skills), and veggie packets for the grill. And the entire thing is dishwasher safe. What could be better?  *LOVE* I am now completely obsessed with this machine. Highly recommend this along with the two cookbook deal, Inspiralized and The Skinnytaste Cookbook.  Great product but a little delicate . stainless would be more durable but of course more expensive  The Paderno World Cuisine Tri-Blade is as reviewed. I scoured multiple reviews to find the best spiralizer and have not been disappointed. Many people liked this one better than the 4 blade system so I decided to get this one instead of the 4 blade. The amount of vegetable left on the spiralizer after using it is very minimal and it is quick to use. It attaches in a sturdy fashion with the suction cup feet.  This is really awesome! It makes making zoodles or any other type of vegetable noodles really easy, I got the package that includes four razor blades, and it\\\\s definitely worth it, each different razor allows you to make different sized zoodles, and I\\\\m sure each one will come in handy at one point or another. If you\\\\re on a paleo diet, this is a must have, it makes eating vegetables a lot more enjoyable.  Easy to operate with very little exertion required. Makes great zucchini spaghetti! First time I made it I mixed it with pasta spaghetti and my husband didn\\\\t even know half was zucchini! The blades are easy to change, its easy to clean and the suction cups hold it firm to the counter (we have smooth granite countertops which probably helps).  I love it. It makes cooking so much fun.  The three blades are nice and they tuck under the product for storage so they won\\\\t get lost. The product is easy to use and all dishwasher safe which is nice. I haven\\\\t used it a lot to know how well the blades hold their sharpness, but so far, I really like this product.  This makes perfect spiral veggies and fun to use. It also is easy to store because of the way it fits so compact into itself. We did not have small children around but I am sure you could find some fun ways to get you little ones to eat their veggies with this unit....  Just love this gadget. I have made some very healthy salads out of raw beets, sweet potatoes and probably any other fresh vegetable. I have also used this to use zucchini instead of pasta for tomatoe sauce. Very tasty. Even better than pasta. Easy to clean.  This thing is amazing. I had the little hand held one and it just took FOREVER, and my hand always cramped up, got cut, and turned the color of whatever I was making. This is SO FAST and easy. Easy to clean also, and really doesn\\\\t take up too much room.  I\\\\ve been experimenting on fresh salads lately and I felt that I needed something fancy to attract the kids to the type of food I prepare them. This was a lifesaver. A little change in the shape and they\\\\ve taken interest already.  This is very well made, easy to assemble and disassemble. Makes cooking fun. Have used it with carrots, hard winter squashes( peel before hand , zucchini, potatoes, beets, etc. Very happy with the purchase.  Love it. Super easy to clean and use. If your deciding between the 3 and 4 blade; 3 blade pretty much covers everything. I am new to veggie noodles but so far so good!  Great product-- love!  Love this thing! It works perfectly. Very easy to set up, use and clean. It takes me five minutes to make a huge bowl of zoodles. Game changer! Highly recommend.  I love this product. It is so easy and quick to use and produces great results. I ended up buying several for family and recommend it to friends all the time!  Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He uses it all the time. It is so easy to use and works fast! Easy clean up too.  Works just like it\\\\s supposed to! Easy to use and clean up...takes up very little space on the counter! I will use it often  Amazing kitchen tool, love making my pasta salads with this! So fun, my children love to help with this too.  great item, works better than others costing lots more, easy to clean, fun to use bought one or my daughter too  Love this for making noodles from squash and zucchini, and curly fries from sweet potatoes! Pretty easy cleanup.  Works wonderfully. Clean up is easy and it\\\\s incredibly easy to operate and clean up.  I bought it to curl potatoes and the result was excellent! It\\xc3\\xa2??s fun to eat now.  Awesome makes veggies look like spaghetti. Best one I ever bought  Gave as gifts and they liked it very much. Use every day.  worked great!! make sure to wash it right away though.  This is so easy to use and clean. So fast. Love it.  very fast and does just what it says  Great product, great transaction.  Easy to assemble easy to use.  It slices and dices!  Convenient to use!  Simply the best!  I love it .  Okay, I gave this as a gift last year, and I love it, however, I bought myself a cheap knockoff of a Vegetti, and it does the job just fine, but I couldn\\\\t give a gourmand a cheap knockoff without looking cheap, which I am, but still....  it was a gift  wonderful!',\n",
       " ' This is an excellent small vac, works well, handy to use, powerful, does the job of cleaning up dust/dirt in a relatively small area. Much more power than cordless vacs, and no recharging needed, but you do have to allow for the cord. No problem for me. The power brush is a terrific feature, works very well, as does the detachable hose which connects to standard vac accessories from our main full-size Kenmore vacuum. You can see the dirt accumulation in the transparent container, and it\\\\s very easy to clean. We\\\\ve had this vac for several years and I\\\\d highly recommend it.  I bought this to replace a dirt devil-style hand vacuum. This is only a bit heavier, but the rotating brush makes it much more effective than a hand vacuum that only has suction. I\\\\m using it on a small, low-pile area rug in my room because I don\\\\t have room to store a larger vacuum cleaner. It works like a charm! It also doesn\\\\t have the issues I\\\\ve had with battery-powered hand vacuums in the past that start to lose charge too quickly and become less powerful before I\\\\ve finished the job as the battery ages. The cord is sufficiently long for my small room, but if I were to vacuum a staircase, it wouldn\\\\t be much trouble to use an extension cord. (I\\\\m not sure why I was so prejudiced against corded hand vacuums in the past.) The cord wraps neatly around the base of the vacuum for storage, so without a separate battery-charging dock or power adapter, it\\\\s actually more compact and easier to store than my previous hand vacuums.  Oh my goodness this is a great little vacuum. Since it\\\\s a plug in, the power and suction is amazing. Be sure to keep the filter cleaned after use so the suction doesn\\\\t go away. Like the cup that\\\\s easy to empty. The features are great. I\\\\d like this in a little bigger size. Comes in so handy and I use it to clean my car and the little crumbs I find on my carpet after snack time. Very happy with this product.  So happy I made this purchase. I\\\\ve purchased a few attachments for my vacuum to do my carpeted stairs but as soon as I would start using it the suction was lost and the beater bar would no longer turn. This hand held corded vacuum is amazing. I use it for a lot of things, vacuuming animal hair off of my couch! awesome suction, i love that it is corded so I don\\\\t have to worry about a battery dying.  Absolutely love this hand-held vacuum! Overrun with fur from two sweet golden retrievers and a cat I needed something powerful but small enough to keep plugged in and hidden for quick clean up jobs. The Riser Visor makes vacuuming vertical surfaces a breeze! I was skeptical of the negative reviews regarding the weight of the vacuum - I haven\\\\t found that to be a problem.  This is a great little vacuum useful for stairs, small areas and cleaning up around the house. It works well on carpet. We use the hose to clean out drawers and areas that we used to use a dust buster for. Having a power cord means no charging or dead batteries. This vacuum has a lot of suction power. I would definitely recommend.  great little handheld vacuum! this little guy has quite a bit of power! it is perfect for my carpeted stairs and all those places it\\\\s difficult for a normal vacuum to work. Cleans up hair from all 3 of my animals without a problem. By far the best little vacuum I\\\\ve ever had!  After 2 other handheld Vacuums which were not effective and one died after 1 use. The Eureka vacuum is excellent! Nice long cord which allows me to vacuum my entire stairway. Easy to attach and clean. Highly recommend this item.  GOT MINE IN 2012 AND STILL USE IT TODAY. PROBABLY THE BEST BUY FOR A SMALL CORDED VAC YOU\\\\LL FIND. POWERFUL, COMPACT, AND UGLY ENOUGH THAT NOBODY WILL STEAL IT. GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.  I LOVE this little guy. Cleans up the cat fur off our microfiber couches so easily. I find myself using it so much more than I expected to because it\\\\s so easy to grab it and clean!  Great for stairs and furniture. Switchable to clean horizontal and vertical surfaces. Easy to clean. Incredibly handy with a LONG cord too.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Exactly what I was looking for to clean my stairs and little messes made by my children. Awesome product.  We use this vacuum every week to clean our stairs. So less cumbersome than a full size vacuum and makes it a lot quicker.  I\\\\ve never been very impressed with hand vacs but this little thing pulls some real suction. It does a great job!  It works great for the stairs and for the car. Better suction than my shark! I\\\\ve recommended it to many people.  A bit noisy but quite powerful AND not bulk. I bought several of them for my family members. They all love it.  Works great on pet hair. It has the power brush, and the corded motor produces a good bit of suction ..  This is a great product. Light weight with lots of suction make this an excellent choice.  A small vacuum, but is very powerful. Allows for reach at ceiling and floor corners.  So far, a great vacuum for quick cleanups around the house and for carpeted stairs.  Thing is a beast. Don\\\\t mind having to empty it out as much as I thought I would.  it removes cat hair so well, it is very powerful and easy to use ..  Awesome little vacuum, works better than my Kirby on the stairs!  Great little stair vacuum! Even does the front of the stairs!  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. Great suction, easy to clean.  Great for cleaning Cat hair of the furniture.  Works amazing. So much power. Does the job  My camper vacumm, does the job ver well.  would buy again great product ..  Better than the Oreck hand held.  Works great. Glad I bought it.  given as a gift, works fine  Man this thing is powerful!  Great little cleaner!!!  works very well  I\\\\d orchestrated to get the diminutive Dyson, but the reviews of this vacuum persuaded me to give it an endeavor. It\\\\s absolutely excellent. It\\\\s the best handheld vacuum I\\\\ve ever endeavored, and I\\\\ve thrown more of these things away than I can recollect. Fortuitously, I\\\\ve always preserved the affixes. Sometimes they fit another model, sometimes they don\\\\t. Since there\\\\s no fancy coupling required to annex implements to the hose terminus of this one, it\\\\s just friction, most felt it.  I have been struggling to find a vacuum for my stairs to get all the dirt and cat hair up and this does the job with no problem',\n",
       " ' Fantastic. I have a HUGE Sears battery in my car that I keep stored during the winter. It only gets driven every other week or so in the winter. It\\\\s my garage kept fun car. This really helps maintain the battery and I get strong starts every time. Can\\\\t complain at all. If you\\\\re buying this to charge a dead battery, it won\\\\t do that. These things need a battery that at least has SOME charge on it. However, hook the dead battery up to another battery that isn\\\\t dead and leave it over night. They\\\\ll equilibrate and then this will go ahead and finish off the charge.  I decided to go with he California energy compliant model even though I don\\\\t live in California for the more efficient unit. It was actually cheaper with the Amazon coupon but I would have spent a few dollars more for it. The unit also has some extra safety features built into it over the other non complaint model. Worth buying it over the normal model because it is more efficient, has more safety features, newer and updated in my opinion.  Works like the older model always has. Weighs about 1/3 what the previous model weighed, it is very light. LED is difficult to see in ambient light. Seems like it should cost considerably less. Happy with it, and it does what I want it to.  I like this new style for my motorcycles as it is energy efficient and specifically built for that application of newer style batteries. My older version were not made for the specific type of new batteries now being used on motorcycles and I was concerned they were overcharging them possibly reducing the life of the battery. I will still use the other for a boat battery. I tried still new style over this last summer and it seemed to work better with the new technology. I have since bought a second one for the other bike for storage this winter. If you buy one of these, research each model closely since there are a lot of varieties for specific needs.  My mother leaves and goes to Hawaii to get away from our mountain winters. Her car used to sit in her garage and even though myself and others could start and run the engine for a while, after 6 months the battery would die. So when my mom returned from Hawaii she would need to buy a new battery! Now with this Battery Tender at work(and all seems to be working) the battery should be good when she gets back to the mountains(the car is garaged). I\\\\ll do a follow up in April when she returns as that will give enough time to see how well the Tender works  These things are the best! Out of the box you just connect it up to the battery, plug it in and that\\\\s it. It flashes red while charging, then goes (and stays) green. When you want to ride (I got it for the bike) just unplug it and go. Simple, fast, efficient. Never worry about the battery charge again.  I can not rate this high enough. I needed this for my motorcycle. I installed the pigtail lead in under ten minutes and everything else is history. These are wonderful for extending the life of a battery for years longer than normally expected. I rated it 5 stars and I\\\\m giving it another five stars here!  Purchased 2 for my Winnie Minnie. Slow charging which after my research is the way to go especially with such expensive RV batteries. Have my two 6 volt batteries in series hooked up as well as my chassis battery. Easy to hook up and understand per the simple light status.  Ideal product for maintaining batteries on unused equipment. Don\\\\t be fooled into purchasing low price chargers. Many don\\\\t have UL approva,l are manufactured with substandard components, and present a serious fire hazard.  what an awesome gizmo. works perfect. it comes with enough attachments to make you happy, but additional ones are available for cheap. doesn\\\\t get any better. should probably be included inside every bike sold.  An excellent trickle charger for my Polaris RZR\\\\s. Without this charger my batteries would fail over the long Northern Michigan Winter. This is my second Winter using this product. Excellent.  Very pleased with purchase. I keep my bike in an outdoor unheated shed and this battery tender has kept my bike charged, and have no problems with my battery. Wish I had purchased this years ago.  I have many toys and they all have these Tenders on them. I got tired of replacing batteries all the time. This is my 11th Battery Tender that I have bought. They work great!  It says it wont charge a dead battery, but it charged my dead motorcycle battery just fine and now im back to riding. These things are awesome!  I\\\\VE HAD DOZENS OF THESE FOR MY BOAT, RVS, SHOW CARS, FARM VEHICLES, AND AIRPLANE. I KEEP ALL MY BATTERIES FULLY CHARGED WITH THESE. THEY ARE GREAT.  I bought this to avoid the need to remove the battery of my motorcycle every winter and it seems to be performing well after a few months of use.  Works Great, this is the second one I have bought so I can charge my mower and motorcycle both  great product, i have two and plan to buy three more so all my bikes will be hooked up...  I used this on my motorcycle after having a dead battery and it has worked like a charm.  Love them.  Works well when using a battery backup with our QuadraFire Pellet Stove.  Great item, now I can park my car for a month without the battery dying.  Bought 2 of these. Best trickle chargers I have ever had  Works great!

       " ' My parents have had a peculator for many years and I loved the coffee it produced but they spent a lot of money on it when they were in Europe. Thankfully I was able to find one on Amazon for a pretty good deal! Keep in mind though, this won\\\\t fix you a cup of espresso with foam and frothiness. This is a simple espresso maker that gives you great coffee in its purest form. With that said I will move on to why this is an amazing product. A friend of mine who is originally from Cuba recommended cafe Bustello (yellow can red writing) that I conveniently found in our local Publix grocery store. Lets just say this stuff is amazing! It comes out dark and just a little bit thicker than regular coffee without any grit to it. We purchased sugar cubes to go into our little espresso cups to ensure the right amount of sugar. It makes just about six cups or espresso so it was perfect for the two of us. I have used regular coffee grounds in it. Just got some whole bean coffee and ground it up really fine in my electric grinder. Tasted great that way too if you are looking for something different. I do recommend washing it after use when it is cooled down. The rubber rind on the bottom side of the top pot does get stained when it sits there on the coffee grounds for too long. And also drying it so it doesn\\\\t dry out the rubber ring or cause rust on the peculator.  In my opinion, this pot makes the best tasting coffee of either espresso or regular type, even better than a French press. I got the big pot because it makes 1 large mug of regular coffee, as well as the espresso that it was designed for. I fill the bottom half with water to just below the valve and loose pack the coffee compartment with my favorite blend. A medium grind will do, which makes pre-ground coffee and option when I am too lazy to grind fresh beans. Put it on my stove\\\\s smallest burner under medium heat and wait. 14 minutes later I have a hot 12 oz. cup of coffee in the upper chamber. Yum. The pot is made of heavy duty aluminum and cleans up easily. My only departure from the description given is that I have never had it make coffee for me in 4-5 minutes. It has always taken 14 minutes. Maybe that was a misprint, or a different heating method was used?  I\\\\ve had this espresso make for over a couple years now. I just want to say it has spoiled me. It takes a little time to make, but it makes the best cup of espresso. I can\\\\t say that enough. In the time I\\\\ve own this pot I\\\\ve bought a couple machines ranging from $200 - $300. Had espresso at starbucks, at work, they have a few different machines that probably cost $20k. Out of them all this little pot still make the richest, full flavored cup I\\\\ve ever had. All those other machines make a light brown, bitter cup. But not this little guy. It just amazes me. If you like, rich, dark, black, espresso this is what you want. Here\\\\s some tips. Grind your own espresso roast beans. I like the Starbucks espresso roasts. I have my own burr grinder (kitchen aid). I have it set to grind it just fine enough that it doesn\\\\t fall through the filter while brewing. It\\\\s setting 7.5, but it will vary on how you\\\\ve adjusted your grinder. And that\\\\s it. The pot does the rest. If you\\\\re making cappuccino have the milk ready, heated and foamed. I use 1/4 cup milk to a shot (2.75oz). As soon as the espresso is done brewing I pour it right into the milk. The longer it\\\\s exposed to air the more bitter it will get. So right into the milk. I\\\\ll post a picture of the shot it pulls next time I make one. The only con is that it takes probably 5-10mins to make. Which is why I tried a couple machines. I figured if a $35 pot can make this good espresso imagine what a $300 machine could do. And they make them so quick. I was so wrong. The machines made this horrible bitter shots, and I kept thinking, there must be something wrong with this thing. I just paid $300 and I\\\\m getting this light brown water (sometimes it would pull a dark shot, but always bitter). Anyway, I\\\\d this guy a shot before spend hundreds of dollars on a machine.  I got this espresso maker after looking at a review on YouTube. I unpackaged it and used it while we had company during Christmas and ended up giving it to our daughter because she enjoyed it so much. I guess ai will have to buy another one now. It is great for preparing a regular cup of coffee or stronger espresso. It also is available in different sizes to fit your needs. I got the smaller 4 cup coffee maker.  Love it. Perks fast and tastes great. I havent had to replace the screens yet. Just keep washing them out with water. DO NOT PUT IN DISHWASHER! I made the horrible mistake to and hadto buy a new one!! Yes i know i should have read instructions.  Awesome Moka pot. I did a lot of research before selecting this pot and I am very happy with my choice. I definitely recommend using fresh ground beans with this pot. It makes a difference. Good construction, easy maintenance, good coffee.  With this moka pot, I enjoy a nice cup of coffee every morning. I used to make coffee with a french press. Now I use my french press to froth the milk to obtain some great cappuccino/latte.  This coffee maker gave me a couple great years of use. the rubber gasket finally went after 2 years or so, so i\\\\ll have to pick up a new one. but makes half a standard mug of great coffee!  Very solid build and its all Italian made. It\\\\s easy to clean as well. Making coffee in it is hard at first but once you find the right setting on your stove it\\\\s all worth it.  Works perfectly--like all my smaller Bialetti pots. I was afraid it would take much longer to boil through, and, of course, it takes a little longer, but still works well.  A very nice expresso maker. The recipient was full of praise for this item. Has had a good experience with it, although its not my cuppa. I\\\\d highly recommend to others.  good quality, strong  Great stovetop espresso/coffee maker. Seems much more durable than copycat products, can be used to make strong espresso down to something more akin to drip.  Received this as a gift from my fianc\\xc3\\xa9 who doesn\\\\t love coffee but I certainly do. A much cheaper and more authentic way to get a delicious tasting espresso.  Good product for STRONG coffee lovers. Couldn\\\\t believe how much stronger than drip coffee makers and uses much less coffee grounds to make.  great looking and durable espresso maker. They have been around so long for a reason. My entire family in Italy has this espresso maker.  Seen these my whole life and always wondered about them. Using it now and it works great, very east to use, tastes great also.  Perfect size, works perfectly. Don\\\\t forget to order the package of 3 gaskets and a filter just to have on hand.  I bought this for my 21 year old son - he said it works perfectly - had been wanting one - not too expensive.  Good to brew your own espresso. Make sure u you get it large enough if you like coffee  Got this for my daughter, she loves it. She said it makes the best coffee. Big hit.  This is the best! I make my own latte\\\\s at home with this and a aerolatte.  Super easy to use and coffee tastes great. Using supreme bustelo espresso.  Received item in great condition.Would definitely deal again.  Excellent product, excellent delivery time 100% recommended!  The Bialetti moka pot makes the best home espresso. 5 stars  Great product. Have others before and really liked them  Works really well and is very good quality. Thank You!!  I used two times a day and I have no problem with it  Love my Jo, this makes my hand ground beans awesome  Fun, beautiful, and makes delicious coffee!  Coffee comes out strong and tastes great.  Makes coffee and it is very high quality  Make yourself awesome espresso at home  works great. makes great coffee  makes great expresso and coffee  best coffee I\\\\ve ever had  Love it, still using it.  makes great expresso  Best espresso maker!

       " ' I typically purchase the standard plastic containers, but tired of the stains from spaghetti sauce and other foods. I love these containers. Thick and sturdy glass in various sizes. I originally wanted the red lids; however, the blue is really nice. Delivery was quick and the packaging was great. Lots of protection against breakage.  I love this set and use it all the time. So much better than the plastic ones and come out nicely clean in dishwasher...although do not put the lids in too. They are nicely sized with no too tiny ones you never use. Highly recommend this set for its quality and usefulness and nothing beats Pyrex.  Love these containers. They seal very well and haven\\\\t had a problem with any leaking liquids or the lids falling off while storing food in my backpack on the way to work. They are pretty solid and feel heavy which makes them feel expensive. I got them on a deal and it was VERY worth the money I paid.  This a great set for cold storage and reheating. We replaced plastic containers that were staining and did not fare well on the microwave. These glass containers store easy by nesting in themselves and the lids fit well and seal tight I recommend this product  Very versatile and great for everything from storage to good prep. Lids hold securely and air tight. They also stack pretty well and dont slip when on top of one another cause the lids are quite grippy. With proper care they will last forever as will most Pyrex products.  It\\\\s so convenient to be able to store food in the same dish it was cooked in. I love this set! These are solid glass baking dishes just as we have come to expect from Pyrex. The covers fit snugly and stack easily if needed. Nice variety of sizes for different needs.  Very nice storage set that keeps food fresh for a long time. Pyrex is a brand I trust as I\\\\ve dropped and clanged these dishes and they have not chipped or broke. I recieved the Pyrex 10 piece storage set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  Very nice, high quality. I use these to store all my tomato based sauces, as well as anything else that is acidic. They wash up great. There are no stains on these! Because of that, they look so much nicer than my old plastic containers ever did after one use.  Variety of sizes. Use thse for everything. Didn\\\\t even bother buying bowls to go along with our plates as these were just fine. It\\\\s not as great as the old durable pyrex, but have not have broken one and thy\\\\ve been all over.  The range of sizes is exactly what I needed. They store compactly, nestled inside each other (I put the lid on the bottom to separate the layers of glass. Microwave and dishwasher safe (top rack for lids).  Nice Set at the price. I love pyrex products and i needed a set like this. With the price it was a great deal. Covers are boring blue color but i don\\\\t really mind that.  Bought them for my girlfriend, she loves them. They are super stout, and are all one color which my OCD girlfriend appreciates.  This is a very nice set of bowls from Pyrex. They are just the right size for leftovers and the dot pattern is cheerful too!  I love Pyrex and have never been disappointed in one of their products! Great set of containers!  Who doesn\\\\t love Pyrex and how amazing it is???? Great purchase for the price.  Very handy containers for leftovers. Can\\\\t go wrong with polka dots!  Best purchase I made when I threw away all my plastic containers.  Good price and nice product. Love glassware versus the plastic.  I always buy Pyrex for the quality and a good price.  Arrived on time and assembled easily.  Great product - works as advertised!  Great Price! Present for My mother  Great, they come in very handy.  Very useful and great quality!  good quality! I love them.  great price for this set  whats not to like?  love the bowls.  Love my Pyrex  No complaints  Great storage  Great quality  Very sturdy  Love them!  Love these  excellent  I love these.  I LIKE THEM']"

       "[' The package is different. The color of the toner water is yellowish, which supposes to be clear. Suspicious quality.  I just received the Rose Petal Witch Hazel in the new bottle. (purchased from a different site) I\\\\ve been using this product for years and am sorely disappointed in this new version. I thought that only the bottle had been changed, but clearly the formula itself has been altered. Comparing the old versus the new side by side, there are dramatic differences. The old has a wonderful rose scent, the new smells like soap. The old has a very silky caressing texture when applied to the face, the new feels almost astringent and leaves the skin tacky. Why in the world would you want to change something that worked so beautifully. This means I can no longer trust any of your other products either... will really miss the cucumber, also. What a shame...  Claims to moisturize and reduce acne, so I bought this for my (very oily) face and used it at night on my entire face. When I woke up I had a huge red, raw stretch of skin from the corners of my mouth to the bottom of my chin. Days later this patch of skin is not only still very very dry and red, but it is also peeling and forming far more pimples than usual. If you have ever experienced any level of skin sensitivity I would not recommend this product, as my skin isn\\\\t really that sensitive and I don\\\\t have any allergies.  I receive different not like what showing in photo  I do not recommend this product at all.  I would give this product a 5 star based on its results, but when I got it the bottle was leaking. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone!  Horrible for skin  The bottle package is different from the website picture. I don\\\\t know why! And it\\\\s useless.  Received the toner, but the bottle is different with that I purchased before. The bottle is leeking, which looks like fake product. I will return.  Haven\\\\t tried the product yet but it came with the label half torn off and a large sticker covering the rest of it. Almost tempted to send back.',\n",
       " ' I got this for my parents who love coffee. They didn\\\\t really like this product and actually went back to their old coffee grinder.. Something about how the beans weren\\\\t grinded up too well or something.. So I\\\\m guessing this product isn\\\\t really for coffee addicts.  On a mission to replace my last coffee bean grinder I spent considerable time reading reviews of the top-rated ones. I finally decided on this one. Big mistake. The KRUPS F203 does, indeed, grind coffee beans. But trying to transfer the grounds to one\\xc3\\xa2??s coffee maker results in a huge mess. (I wouldn\\xc3\\xa2??t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices. But it\\xc3\\xa2??s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans.) Summary: I quit grinding coffee beans shortly after I started using this grinder. Thanks to this purchase, I\\xc3\\xa2??m back to buying pre-ground coffee. Gimme my old grinder back! Recommendation: against all reviews, do not buy.  This makes a huge mess! Coffee grinds everywhere. Need a brush to get them out. Grinds get compacted under the blades and will not come out unless you use a brush and then it becomes a mess. I am shopping for something else. Do NOT buy this!  Yikes. The current model is made in China and fills the room with a very pungent electricity smell and does not have the power my old Krups Grinder had. DO NOT BUY  After a couple of months doesn\\\\t grid beans well. Big pieces in grids.  Bad!',\n",

       " ' I had the same problem that others on Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\\\\m doing here right now). I just purchased this same filter from Walmart recently along with a brand new Brita water pitcher (yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each other...and the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well). I thought I was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing; and watching the \\\\dirty\\\\ water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir I just cringed and scratched my head... After triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly, I pushed so darn hard that I was ready for the unit to break, the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housing...and alas, water still leaks through and the filter clearly does NOT seal well with this unit. I find it almost humorous that I only came here to read these Amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after I decided to Google my problem and see if there was a magic solution, and I see Brita repeatedly replying with we\\\\re sorry! call our customer service and we will help!...or you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down. If you go onto Brita\\\\s website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there, you will ALSO find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass through...along with the same sad responses from Brita support which seemingly makes Brita look like they\\\\re being proactive. Unfortunately as in this case, sometime\\\\s replying with the same canned responses that don\\\\t really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well; clearly Brita is in denial or won\\\\t publicly accept fault for this issue. I think the worst part in all of this though, is that there are likely many consumers who get their new Brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old Brita filters worked, and they don\\\\t even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesn\\\\t seal properly/completely in a water-tight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus. So all of the great things Brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this. You\\\\re buying a filter to clean your water, you don\\\\t even notice its NOT cleaning your water, and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightly-less-dirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesn\\\\t seal well. The essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter ALL of the water, not just most of it...if the product can\\\\t filter 99.99999% of the water being poured into it, then it is most certainly a defective product. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Brita that they aren\\\\t purposely and knowingly selling a defective filter-design, it\\\\s still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isn\\\\t lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters. FYI, Brita Customer Service, if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct, we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews, and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly, properly, and easily sealed when inserted...then I know you haven\\\\t read or care about what I say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue. No need for me to call Brita customer service either, I\\\\m going to buy a filter now from your competitor and I can only hope it works the way it should. Thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your CEO and COO and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet.  I have a water tester and my water tested with as many or more particles after using the filter. It does get rid of the chlorine and they put a lot of chlorine in our water (rural water system).  Filter leaks and a large portion of the water does not get filtered through my Brita 10 cup Grand Water pitcher. I purchased this filter so as to remove the unpleasant taste of tap water, this filter only diminishes the taste as much of the water still gets through unfiltered as this does not accurately fit my pitcher.  fits better ..... Water taste exactly like that comes out of the rap which is awful. Shame,I\\\\ve been a happy customer for many years.  Was messed up in the box. Wouldn\\\\t recomment! AND it doesn\\\\t filter out lead!  leaking black water for days.....water tastes weird  did not work on camping trip, tried to filter my urinne to make clean water. how do i apply for a refund?',\n",
       " ' They tore up after a little over a year, and I\\\\m not very strong... Poor quality, also one of the handle got bent (but you can still work out with it). When they tear it can be painful, so I suggest if you must buy this brand, replace every year.  The product is good, the problem is I didn\\\\t get the yellow and green bands. I also didn\\\\t get the manual that was supposed to be included.  The quality of the rubber band is not vey good.',\n",
       " ' Zucchini or any other veggies that I have tried in this just will not stay in place and I end up with a mess all over the counter. I\\\\m not ready to give up yet, but I am very disappointed so far.  We have used our veggie slicer twice, both times with fun results. However, the reason for the low rating this that on the second use, one of the metal grater teeth broke off! Thankfully we caught it before cooking and serving the veggies but beware! I will be requesting a refund.  Looks cool. Does some cool stuff. Be honest with yourself - you probably do not need another kitchen gadget that you will use 4 times a year.  Honestly this thing takes up a lot of room.... If you can find the flat spiraler that moves like a clock over a small bowl you will be much happier.  Terrible cheap product. Wish I hadn\\\\t bought it.  This was a gift fr my daughter and broke the first time she tried to use it.',\n",
       " ' Works great, except for two big issues. First, its incredibly difficult to shut off from the spin position. I\\\\m talking makes your skin raw. I\\\\ve resorted to using something rigid to click it off. I think this happens because the switch you use to release the bag is the power switch, and basically when you have it in the roller position the switch is wedged in as far as it will go. (and I don\\\\t think its just a case of me being weak as I am a 33 year old male whose is a recreational rock climber) My second issue is the brush roller. 90% of the time it does not work for me. I have tried cleaning the roller off multiple times. Basically the trick I use to get it to work is to just smack the side of the roller on the ground, hard. After enough hits, it works again! I will not be buying another one.  The vacuum started off great and worked very well for the price and size. However, about a year after we bought it, the carpet spinner has lost all of its power and can barely even keep moving if I place my hand on it. I wouldn\\\\t recommend it.  inconvenient to use. gotta lift the relatively bulky thing whenever i gotta clean. so a quick cleaning job turns into a mini project. because it\\\\s not cordless. the wire is long but still.  Plastic garbage. It works great (very loud, though) for a few months and then fails to be of any use. Stay away.  This vacuum works OK however the on and off switch is very hard to operate. I would not buy this product again.  Worked OK for under 18 months then motor died.  The Eureka EasyClean vacuum quit working soon after purchasing it.',\n",
       " ' I was looking for something like this on my mechanic\\\\s recommendation because my work/home/errands radius is very small, and the battery was not getting fully charged. After reading all the reviews, I thought that this was the best that we could do. However, within 20 minutes of installing it in my car, we smelled smoke and ran down to see this device on fire. The sound insulation under the hood consequently caught on fire, and burned through the hood, and bits of burning insulation fell into the engine block. This was one of the most frightening things we\\\\ve every experienced, and we were in complete shock and had to put the fire out ourselves. Had we left this unattended and left the house, our entire house would have been up in smoke, particularly because our carport is under the house. The manufacturer passed us onto his insurer, who is stalling on paying our repair costs, saying that it was user error. Use this device at your own risk! I am reporting this device to the local and Federal consumer protection agencies, and am fighting the insurance company to get the body damage on my car repaired. Take a look of the photos I\\\\ve attached, and you can see the positive connection completely blackened and melted, and the damage it did to my hood.  I\\\\ve owned BatteryMINDer chargers for years with very good experiences. I bought this BatteryTender Jr. on impulse as a Lightning Deal. It was so useless at charging my car batteries I was convinced that it was defective. I repeatedly had the experience were I put it on fully charged battery only to have the batery BE DEAD the next day! It worked as a battery DIScharger! I think the 0.75 amps capacity of the Jr is not enough to even maintain the battery charged while mounted in the car, much less charge it. I put larger Genius and BatteryMINDer chargers on those cars where the Jr failed and they are now topped off. I was about to toss the Battery Tender Jr when I swapped it to charge the small gel cell battery on my emergency generator. For the first time I got a green light so my Jr has a mission. I don\\\\t recommend buying this one unless you want it for maintaining a small battery.  This item should last longer than 6 uses over three years. Just quit in December 2015, purchased Feb 2013. Warranty is basically worthless - check reports on line. Appears company doesn\\\\t stand behind their product. I\\\\ll go to a NOCO and try that instead',\n",

       "[' The package is different. The color of the toner water is yellowish, which supposes to be clear. Suspicious quality.  I just received the Rose Petal Witch Hazel in the new bottle. (purchased from a different site) I\\\\ve been using this product for years and am sorely disappointed in this new version. I thought that only the bottle had been changed, but clearly the formula itself has been altered. Comparing the old versus the new side by side, there are dramatic differences. The old has a wonderful rose scent, the new smells like soap. The old has a very silky caressing texture when applied to the face, the new feels almost astringent and leaves the skin tacky. Why in the world would you want to change something that worked so beautifully. This means I can no longer trust any of your other products either... will really miss the cucumber, also. What a shame...  Claims to moisturize and reduce acne, so I bought this for my (very oily) face and used it at night on my entire face. When I woke up I had a huge red, raw stretch of skin from the corners of my mouth to the bottom of my chin. Days later this patch of skin is not only still very very dry and red, but it is also peeling and forming far more pimples than usual. If you have ever experienced any level of skin sensitivity I would not recommend this product, as my skin isn\\\\t really that sensitive and I don\\\\t have any allergies.  I receive different not like what showing in photo  I do not recommend this product at all.  I would give this product a 5 star based on its results, but when I got it the bottle was leaking. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone!  Horrible for skin  The bottle package is different from the website picture. I don\\\\t know why! And it\\\\s useless.  Received the toner, but the bottle is different with that I purchased before. The bottle is leeking, which looks like fake product. I will return.  Haven\\\\t tried the product yet but it came with the label half torn off and a large sticker covering the rest of it. Almost tempted to send back.',\n",
       " ' I got this for my parents who love coffee. They didn\\\\t really like this product and actually went back to their old coffee grinder.. Something about how the beans weren\\\\t grinded up too well or something.. So I\\\\m guessing this product isn\\\\t really for coffee addicts.  On a mission to replace my last coffee bean grinder I spent considerable time reading reviews of the top-rated ones. I finally decided on this one. Big mistake. The KRUPS F203 does, indeed, grind coffee beans. But trying to transfer the grounds to one\\xc3\\xa2??s coffee maker results in a huge mess. (I wouldn\\xc3\\xa2??t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices. But it\\xc3\\xa2??s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans.) Summary: I quit grinding coffee beans shortly after I started using this grinder. Thanks to this purchase, I\\xc3\\xa2??m back to buying pre-ground coffee. Gimme my old grinder back! Recommendation: against all reviews, do not buy.  This makes a huge mess! Coffee grinds everywhere. Need a brush to get them out. Grinds get compacted under the blades and will not come out unless you use a brush and then it becomes a mess. I am shopping for something else. Do NOT buy this!  Yikes. The current model is made in China and fills the room with a very pungent electricity smell and does not have the power my old Krups Grinder had. DO NOT BUY  After a couple of months doesn\\\\t grid beans well. Big pieces in grids.  Bad!',\n",

       " ' I had the same problem that others on Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\\\\m doing here right now). I just purchased this same filter from Walmart recently along with a brand new Brita water pitcher (yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each other...and the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well). I thought I was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing; and watching the \\\\dirty\\\\ water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir I just cringed and scratched my head... After triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly, I pushed so darn hard that I was ready for the unit to break, the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housing...and alas, water still leaks through and the filter clearly does NOT seal well with this unit. I find it almost humorous that I only came here to read these Amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after I decided to Google my problem and see if there was a magic solution, and I see Brita repeatedly replying with we\\\\re sorry! call our customer service and we will help!...or you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down. If you go onto Brita\\\\s website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there, you will ALSO find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass through...along with the same sad responses from Brita support which seemingly makes Brita look like they\\\\re being proactive. Unfortunately as in this case, sometime\\\\s replying with the same canned responses that don\\\\t really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well; clearly Brita is in denial or won\\\\t publicly accept fault for this issue. I think the worst part in all of this though, is that there are likely many consumers who get their new Brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old Brita filters worked, and they don\\\\t even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesn\\\\t seal properly/completely in a water-tight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus. So all of the great things Brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this. You\\\\re buying a filter to clean your water, you don\\\\t even notice its NOT cleaning your water, and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightly-less-dirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesn\\\\t seal well. The essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter ALL of the water, not just most of it...if the product can\\\\t filter 99.99999% of the water being poured into it, then it is most certainly a defective product. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Brita that they aren\\\\t purposely and knowingly selling a defective filter-design, it\\\\s still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isn\\\\t lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters. FYI, Brita Customer Service, if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct, we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews, and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly, properly, and easily sealed when inserted...then I know you haven\\\\t read or care about what I say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue. No need for me to call Brita customer service either, I\\\\m going to buy a filter now from your competitor and I can only hope it works the way it should. Thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your CEO and COO and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet.  I have a water tester and my water tested with as many or more particles after using the filter. It does get rid of the chlorine and they put a lot of chlorine in our water (rural water system).  Filter leaks and a large portion of the water does not get filtered through my Brita 10 cup Grand Water pitcher. I purchased this filter so as to remove the unpleasant taste of tap water, this filter only diminishes the taste as much of the water still gets through unfiltered as this does not accurately fit my pitcher.  fits better ..... Water taste exactly like that comes out of the rap which is awful. Shame,I\\\\ve been a happy customer for many years.  Was messed up in the box. Wouldn\\\\t recomment! AND it doesn\\\\t filter out lead!  leaking black water for days.....water tastes weird  did not work on camping trip, tried to filter my urinne to make clean water. how do i apply for a refund?',\n",
       " ' They tore up after a little over a year, and I\\\\m not very strong... Poor quality, also one of the handle got bent (but you can still work out with it). When they tear it can be painful, so I suggest if you must buy this brand, replace every year.  The product is good, the problem is I didn\\\\t get the yellow and green bands. I also didn\\\\t get the manual that was supposed to be included.  The quality of the rubber band is not vey good.',\n",
       " ' Zucchini or any other veggies that I have tried in this just will not stay in place and I end up with a mess all over the counter. I\\\\m not ready to give up yet, but I am very disappointed so far.  We have used our veggie slicer twice, both times with fun results. However, the reason for the low rating this that on the second use, one of the metal grater teeth broke off! Thankfully we caught it before cooking and serving the veggies but beware! I will be requesting a refund.  Looks cool. Does some cool stuff. Be honest with yourself - you probably do not need another kitchen gadget that you will use 4 times a year.  Honestly this thing takes up a lot of room.... If you can find the flat spiraler that moves like a clock over a small bowl you will be much happier.  Terrible cheap product. Wish I hadn\\\\t bought it.  This was a gift fr my daughter and broke the first time she tried to use it.',\n",
       " ' Works great, except for two big issues. First, its incredibly difficult to shut off from the spin position. I\\\\m talking makes your skin raw. I\\\\ve resorted to using something rigid to click it off. I think this happens because the switch you use to release the bag is the power switch, and basically when you have it in the roller position the switch is wedged in as far as it will go. (and I don\\\\t think its just a case of me being weak as I am a 33 year old male whose is a recreational rock climber) My second issue is the brush roller. 90% of the time it does not work for me. I have tried cleaning the roller off multiple times. Basically the trick I use to get it to work is to just smack the side of the roller on the ground, hard. After enough hits, it works again! I will not be buying another one.  The vacuum started off great and worked very well for the price and size. However, about a year after we bought it, the carpet spinner has lost all of its power and can barely even keep moving if I place my hand on it. I wouldn\\\\t recommend it.  inconvenient to use. gotta lift the relatively bulky thing whenever i gotta clean. so a quick cleaning job turns into a mini project. because it\\\\s not cordless. the wire is long but still.  Plastic garbage. It works great (very loud, though) for a few months and then fails to be of any use. Stay away.  This vacuum works OK however the on and off switch is very hard to operate. I would not buy this product again.  Worked OK for under 18 months then motor died.  The Eureka EasyClean vacuum quit working soon after purchasing it.',\n",
       " ' I was looking for something like this on my mechanic\\\\s recommendation because my work/home/errands radius is very small, and the battery was not getting fully charged. After reading all the reviews, I thought that this was the best that we could do. However, within 20 minutes of installing it in my car, we smelled smoke and ran down to see this device on fire. The sound insulation under the hood consequently caught on fire, and burned through the hood, and bits of burning insulation fell into the engine block. This was one of the most frightening things we\\\\ve every experienced, and we were in complete shock and had to put the fire out ourselves. Had we left this unattended and left the house, our entire house would have been up in smoke, particularly because our carport is under the house. The manufacturer passed us onto his insurer, who is stalling on paying our repair costs, saying that it was user error. Use this device at your own risk! I am reporting this device to the local and Federal consumer protection agencies, and am fighting the insurance company to get the body damage on my car repaired. Take a look of the photos I\\\\ve attached, and you can see the positive connection completely blackened and melted, and the damage it did to my hood.  I\\\\ve owned BatteryMINDer chargers for years with very good experiences. I bought this BatteryTender Jr. on impulse as a Lightning Deal. It was so useless at charging my car batteries I was convinced that it was defective. I repeatedly had the experience were I put it on fully charged battery only to have the batery BE DEAD the next day! It worked as a battery DIScharger! I think the 0.75 amps capacity of the Jr is not enough to even maintain the battery charged while mounted in the car, much less charge it. I put larger Genius and BatteryMINDer chargers on those cars where the Jr failed and they are now topped off. I was about to toss the Battery Tender Jr when I swapped it to charge the small gel cell battery on my emergency generator. For the first time I got a green light so my Jr has a mission. I don\\\\t recommend buying this one unless you want it for maintaining a small battery.  This item should last longer than 6 uses over three years. Just quit in December 2015, purchased Feb 2013. Warranty is basically worthless - check reports on line. Appears company doesn\\\\t stand behind their product. I\\\\ll go to a NOCO and try that instead',\n",
       " ' Not a good product. The bottom part threads into the top part but does not completely seal causing steam to escape. The Moka (coffee) sticks on the upper sieve which blocks the steam from going in the upper part. This raises the temperature of the the whole Stovetop causing even more steam escaping and a very hot Stovetop to a dangerous level. It looked very attractive before first use but only after first use it looked unbelievably ugly. A cheap product.  I did not realize I was buying the 2 ounce, it says one cup but is actually 1/2 cup with a measure cup, when I received this I thought it was a toy ! I know I should have read the description better, what a waste of my money and time, how about putting a ruler next to picture or show all 3 sizes side by side.  material changed and effect so easy. couple usage and alum. rusted.
