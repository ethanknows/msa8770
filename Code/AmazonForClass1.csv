7245456313^R10TGP1JSCCE1L^These are hands down the best quality bands for the money^A3EWI5SAK4D6JW^2016-01-16^ These are hands down the best quality bands for the money. I am a 38 year old male and wanted a resistance band set that I could travel with as well as use it at home with my p90 workouts. I specifically wanted bands that were made with high quality material and would not break after a few months. After months of research I pulled the trigger and bought Black Mountain resistance band set. These bands met all of my expectations and more. They are high quality and multiple bands can be combined for added resistance. The travel bag makes it easy to travel with since I am always on the go. My wife always really liked them and we ordered a second set to replace her flimsy less quality bands. Thanks Black Mountain for producing a great product at a fraction of what other competitors are selling them for.^5.00
7245456313^RFZP3C10YMANY^High Quality Bands^A33LO1IBEZAH4R^2016-01-22^ I just got this set yesterday as well as a set from another company so I could compare the quality. The other set seems to be made pretty well, but these from Black Mountain are higher quality. The nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look. I\ve been using resistance bands for years. Not as my sole resistance routine, but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights. Everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they haven\t as they are very effective. As these eventually wear out as they all do in time, I\ll replace them with Black Mountain products again. My only complaint is there is a slip of paper that came with the bands offering me a free orange band, but the phone number given doesn\t seem to connect to anything.^5.00

7245456313^R1DHGVAHJAT0IF^The resistance is great. I would agree that the low resistance is ...^A1J9T6CT4DFV5J^2016-01-13^ I got these for Christmas and have been using them multiple days a week since. The resistance is great. I would agree that the low resistance is pretty worthless but maybe some use it?? I was a little skeptical about the customer service given the review but I called to inquire about these before purchase and they answered right away which gave me a little more confidence. So far so good, I will let you know if there are any issues with the bands themselves after continue usage between 3-4x/wk.^4.00
7245456313^RS8SIGJL3GWZA^Good quality product^A26CJKCHX8CNMM^2016-01-20^ Haven\t had it long enough to use all of the components but so far I\m impressed with the quality of the material. I also really like the fact that you can remove and mix/match the bands using the hooks on each end. All in all, so far so good, and they do what they\re meant to do. Will update once I can try the other exercise positions using the door anchor.^5.00
7245456313^R3A0PFRUY2TYOK^Excellent product^A18ZJ697U6MQAN^2016-01-22^ I\m not a weight guy and I\ve tried resistance bands in the past and was never that impressed. This product is great. It doesn\t have that flimsy, cheap feel. It feels solid and offers good resistance and is easy to use. I\ve used it now for a while and I will keep on using it instead of throwing it in some drawer to gather dust. I would highly recommend this product for both beginners and veterans. And it is compact enough to take with me on trips^5.00
7245456313^RYSDKK3YOHC13^Really delivers!!^A37MFC294G6HOJ^2016-01-18^ I love this product! Upon first receiving it I was skeptical that these would provide a good workout but I can assure you after doing a little 10 minute workout found on YouTube, these little bands deliver! I was so sore after just a short workout. I highly recommend this product to anyone considering a home exercise product to keep themselves fit.^5.00
7245456313^R28UZ3TSLFBQ5J^Great Resistance bands^A11ERR9MSQ1A2^2016-01-25^ Excellent packaging. The whole set fits neatly into the carrying bag. Excellent for travel. The bands appear to be of superior quality when compared to SPRI. Connecters work well, as does the door mount. Stacking the bands is easy, and quality control has ensured that the bands are of consistent length. Awesome purchase.^5.00
7245456313^ROX5Q0BX5PF8A^Good stuff^A1BU1UIUQO2GCQ^2016-01-19^ Received these as a gift. Construction seems pretty legit. I like the Carabiners vice plastic clips of competitors. The handles and other attachment points feel quality. Perfect to stay on track while traveling and can\t take the weights with me. Would recommend this product and company to friends and family.^4.00
7245456313^R217A9VAJO9G0Q^Love â?¤ the tension bands^A2G4EZZRE9YL46^2016-01-15^ Alot of bang for the buck. Effective work out without the hassles of changing weight and buying expensive equipment. Best of all you can take it with you when traveling. It comes with a carrying case and has an instruction manual which clearly shows the different exercises and how to set up what is needed.^5.00
7245456313^R33VNQ4INOKRHR^Good for a light workout^A2PSGA4FK8J4MA^2016-01-14^ Good for a light workout. It is very portable, gives you more variety of exercises you can do and takes up much less space then a set of dumbells. The bands are sturdy and the connections at the end are solid and seem well made. Overall a very good value as long as you aren\t looking for real heavy lifting.^4.00
7245456313^R2G36HZVJRLM5J^Very happy with these bands^AVGBH8V1WCM2H^2016-01-20^ I purchased these bands to help re-strengthen after shoulder surgery, and have been very happy with them. Quality is excellent. It\s fast and easy to change the handles from one band to another, and the carry-bag has made it easy to take these with me wherever I might travel. Highly recommended.^5.00
7245456313^R2JUABSD7Z3FG5^They tore after a year^ADBW7SD7OFDKH^2016-01-20^ They tore up after a little over a year, and I\m not very strong... Poor quality, also one of the handle got bent (but you can still work out with it). When they tear it can be painful, so I suggest if you must buy this brand, replace every year.^1.00
7245456313^R3L3KPEUGOYMKR^Great for limited budget or space^ATCJRYWVODZZB^2016-01-17^ these were perfect for my home gym. Easier to store and move than dumbbells, and significantly cheaper.

B00002NCJI^R3R5GW18R0BH38^Works great!^A2QPK9P0QXK2D0^2016-01-09^ I bought this kit 2 winters ago. We have a ranch house on the side of a mountain and it gets very cold. Combine that with really crummy old windows and our house was freezing. Not good when you pay for home heating oil!!! It was so bad at one point that when it was windy outside, I actually witnessed the drapes in my house billowing into the room. That is when I decided to purchase this kit. I actually got 2 kits to make sure I could finish all the windows in my house, and I ended up having plenty left over. I installed the double sided tape and stuck on the plastic, used the blowdryer to warm it up and shrink wrap the windows, and I was done. No more draft or chilly rooms! You are supposed to take it off after each winter but I have left it on for 2 years now. I find it also keeps my house cooler in the summer. Combined with thermal drapes, you have a combination for energy savings. PROS: - sticks great and lasts for a long time -once you get the hang of it, its easy to install -really has saved us money on home heating oil CONS: - if you don\t totally shrink the plastic, you can see the ripples from the outside of the house and it looks a little messy, but if you do it right it is crystal clear -it is awfully hard to get the double stick tape off if you leave the product up for a long time We are now going into our third winter with the same kit on our windows and we are only now noticing some of the windows are losing their plastic in some places, peeling etc. But thats to be expected when its only supposed to be left on for a shorter period of time.^5.00
B00002NCJI^R1GOV7ZZ8B6C44^I\m saving a bunch of money on gas^AOPXAQV9GT9XO^2016-01-21^ My apartment has a front living room with three windows that let in very cold air in winter, so I moved my living room into the middle dining room. I keep the door between the two rooms open enough for my cats to get through. I rarely go in the front room in winter because it\s so cold. My friend helped me install this insulator, which turned out to be very easy. Just apply the double-sided tape around the frame, attach the plastic, and then blow dry with heat to tighten the plastic. I can barely even see the insulating plastic. The only problem is that I had to decide if I wanted the window blinds up or down, because the plastic covers the entire window casing. You will not be able to use your blinds or shades, just drapery. I\ve lived here in Erie, PA, seven years, and I\ve wasted so much money on gas. When I moved from the front room to the middle room and kept the door between the two ajar instead of wide open, I reduced my monthly gas budget from $98 to $72. Now that I have this product, my monthly amount is $42! Unbelievable!^5.00
B00002NCJI^R2XLMUCV1HG0M^Great product to save money & help comfort in home^AGLTIN68GBSOB^2016-01-22^ This is a great product to prevent leaky windows from succeeding in letting cold air inside. The tape holds well when the outdoor wind blows. PLEASE READ: Exercise patience, measure TWICE before you cut the film and allow for an extra inch, don\t skimp or you will regret it (read: trying to pull too tight when mounting and risk not fitting or tear of film). Glad I bought one extra box to learn from mistakes and not have to wait /endure more cold. I like that visibility outside is not compromised^5.00
B00002NCJI^R1XCMCMYKYWZ88^Amazing product, significanlty warms the room.^A1YPP8TMCYS8RS^2016-01-18^ I love this product, we have an old house and a lot of leaks around the windows. This significantly changes the room temperature, it increased the warmth of the room significantly. It took us one window to figure out the technique for putting it into place and once we got the technique down it was very easy to put in place. Use the hair dryer at the end to tighten up the material and you are good to go. Will be using this for every winter from here on out for the cold Chicago winters.^5.00
B00002NCJI^R1GL2Z7V4IJ012^Great Product^A225SZ1H2NCBKQ^2016-01-19^ Great product, seals great and definitely makes a huge difference in temperature. My heat kicks on less often. Depending on window size, you can sometimes get more than 3 windows out of it! Most important step not to skip is making sure your window sill is CLEAN. If it\s not, the insulator tape is not going to stick, and cold air will seep in.^5.00
B00002NCJI^R1SIX3I21449TJ^Will make you hate keeping room warm^A5ZH9L4QII4A4^2016-01-21^ What a waste of money, first off let me state that is product may work if you ever get it applied to he window. After multiple applications trying to center a giant sheet of Saran Wrap around super sticky tape I am probably qualified to fuel jets mid air. This product is beyond infuriating. Perhaps a team of 4 would have no issues.^1.00
B00002NCJI^R2O35YXEGCQSZF^Should have bought these a long time ago!^A2F7QAIPI2XADZ^2016-01-20^ My brother installed these for me. He used a hot blower gun (sort of like a hair dryer) and it shrunk it so that I cannot even tell that there is plastic over my windows! Seriously, they are invisible. I can tell already that it will keep my daylight basement warmer :). I highly recommend this!^5.00

There is a bit of a learning curve to get them to lay flat, but that\s life kids. I\ve been using them for the past 2 years and I live in Chicago. I can\t verify (due to changing weather temps) if I\ve saved money on my heating bill, but I\d like to think so. It\s well worth the price of them and I DEFINITELY notice the drafts stopped. The windows are always icing up ,from condensation, once it gets below 32º. I\ve tried ceiling fans to keep the air flowing, but to no avail. These window films do the trick every time. No more icing up. No more water from condensation on my window sills. No more mold growth from the moisture. Buy them, put them up and stay warm all season.^5.00

B00002NCJI^R3B0S0GQB2PHRX^Great product easy installation^AIM4BJPC9NKDU^2016-01-12^ This is the first time I used 3M window insulation and istallation was a breeze. The scotch tape held like a champ and the plastic is so clear that if you give it good heat from the hair dryer it almost feels like there is nothing in front of window. Highly recommended for the cold weather. Our heat is off for good few hours during the day and night^5.00
B00002ND64^R3VDD7K6QKDFGF^This little unit SAVED my neighbors house from a 2-story fire.^A15744POPF09R4^2016-01-11^ I purchased this fire extinguisher in 2001, and it has sat on my kitchen counter ever since. On March 17th, 2012, my next door neighbor was outside his house and VERY FOOLISHLY poured gasoline from a full 2.5-gallon container onto a pile of hot smoldering wooden logs. Of course the can exploded and it landed against the outside of his 2-story house. The house is wood frame house with painted wood siding. At this point he was on fire, so he rolled on the ground to put himself out. He ended up with 3rd degree burns, but his next action was to get up and come find me. I was working outside raking leaves when I heard him screaming. By this time the fire is raging against the outside of his house. The flames were about 8-10\ wide against the side of his house and touching the top of his 2nd story gutter. As he was panicking and calling 911, I quickly retrieved the small Kiddie fire extinguisher from my kitchen and ran towards the blaze. At this point I am thinking I am shooting a bb-gun ...

The advertised packaging specifically says it is the only original U.S. packaging, and yet mine was completely different in shape, form, and design.

B00004S7V8^R2XR3AD7BLT5NH^Indispensable tool in my kitchen.^A29NV2YITU0EJK^2016-01-20^ I couldn\t live without this tool in my kitchen. I am zesting and grating regularly and having a Microplane in easy reach is an essential. I have several styles of Microplanes (for grating different things and different sizes) but this is the one I use the most for limes, lemons, oranges, etc. Fits right in the dishwasher when I am done and is always sharp and useful. This was a replacement for one that I had had for many years and it had finally gotten a little dull. But after ten years of essentially daily use, I guess it was allowed to be not so sharp.^5.00
B00004S7V8^R95B4GPOOFBFR^Micropla really is a great grater^A51AFS4EALITN^2016-01-22^ Microplane is a great grater. We bought this planer on the advice of our daughter whose kitchen philosophy is have a few gadgets but make them high quality. This grater planer works very well. I typically use it to zest lemons or to grate Parmesan cheese. It does both jobs perfectly and is easy to clean. NowI buy cheese in a block which is better, cheaper and keeps longer.^5.00
B00004S7V8^R97WCSVD5RRWW^Get rid of that garlic press!^A1OTSZ4HC6GQ8K^2016-01-15^ So this has become one of my favorite kitchen tools.

It\s a delightfully versatile tool that is absolutely worth it.^5.00
